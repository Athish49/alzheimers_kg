The approach was inspired by research that began several decades ago on tau cleavage generating N-terminally truncated fragments that trigger tangle formation ( Feb 2013 news ; Paholikova et al., 2015 ). The AADvac1 vaccine consists of a synthetic peptide derived from amino acids 294 to 305 of the tau sequence, i.e., KDNIKHVPGGGS, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. AADvac1 uses aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. At the 2014 AAIC conference in Copenhagen, preclinical studies were reported as having met safety requirements for up to six months in rats, rabbits, and dogs; a paper reported that the vaccine reduced tau pathology and improved sensorimotor function in transgenic rats ( Aug 2014 news ; Kontsekova et al., 2014 ).

It delivers the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) gene to the subthalamic nucleus, where this enzyme then increases production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA). In people with Parkinson’s disease, increased activity of subthalamic nucleus neurons due to loss of inhibitory input contributes to movement problems such as tremor, rigidity, and difficulty walking. The goal of GAD gene therapy is to boost levels of GABA and normalize activity of these neurons. This is a similar mechanism to subthalamic deep brain stimulation, an approved surgical treatment for Parkinson’s symptoms. The therapy, originally developed at Neurologix Inc., consists of a 1:1 mixture of two adenovirus vectors encoding the GAD-65 and GAD-67 enzyme isoforms, under regulation of cytomegalovirus enhancer–chicken β-actin promoter and woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory elements. It is a given as a one-time injection, utilizing a surgical procedure similar to the implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. In preclinical work in rats, AAV-GAD injection into the subthalamic nucleus on one side led to robust GAD expression on the injected side five months later, but not on the uninjected side. In a toxin-induced Parkinson’s model, AAV-GAD-treated animals maintained significantly higher levels of GABA, better movement, and more dopamine neurons ( Luo et al., 2002 ). An independent group showed efficacy of an AAV-GAD65 vector in Parkinson’s rats ( Kim et al., 2008 ). The gene therapy was safe and improved some motor symptoms in a rhesus monkey model of Parkinson’s ( Emborg et al., 2007 ). In a safety study performed in rats, AAV-GAD was not detected in blood or CSF after subthalamic injection. The vector did not disseminate to any organs outside the brain in most animals, or cause changes in general health or behavior ( Fitzsimons et al., 2010 ).","Overview Name: AAV-GAD Synonyms: AAV-GAD2, NLX-P101 Therapy Type: DNA/RNA-based Target Type: Other Neurotransmitters (timeline) Condition(s): Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2) Company: Hologen Limited, MeiraGTx Limited",ongoing,2.0,False,,21 Nov 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/aav-gad

It is being developed as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease. This small molecule is taken by mouth. Mutations in PINK1 that destroy its kinase activity cause early onset Parkinson’s disease, likely by impairing mitochondria quality control ( Valente et al., 2004 ). Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, identified the PINK1 activator kinetin triphosphate. This ATP analog increased phosphorylation of key substrates, normalized mitochondrial mobility, and reduced apoptosis in response to oxidative stress in human neural cells ( Hertz et al., 2013 ). In fruit flies, kinetin was reported to reduce age-associated mitochondrial DNA deterioration ( Tsai et al., 2022 ). However, kinetin failed to protect against α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration in mouse Parkinson’s models ( Orr et al., 2017 ). Subsequent screening and optimization of kinetin analogs identified MTK458, a brain-penetrant compound that selectively activated PINK1 on mitochondria ( Chin et al., 2023 preprint ). In a mouse model of α-synuclein pathology, MTK458 was reported to increase clearance of defective mitochondria and α-synuclein aggregates and, in a wild-type mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage, it decreased edema, NRLP3 induction, and neurologic outcomes ( Hertz et al., 2024 preprint ; Li et al., 2025 ).

This enzyme has long been known to be highly active in Alzheimer’s disease brain ( Saito et al., 1993 ), but its different isoforms, numerous substrates, and pleiotropic effects made drug discovery difficult. Calpain became an active therapeutic target as more specific inhibitors have become available. The structure, synthesis, and selectivity of ABT-957 has been published ( Jantos et al., 2019 ). Calpain is thought to play a role in several of the pathophysiological processes underlying neurodegeneration. For example, calpain functions in NMDR signaling cascades that lead to neuronal excitotoxicity. It has also been reported to mediate Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction by cleaving the synaptic vesicle protein dynamin 1 (e.g., Wu et al., 2004 ; Kelly et al., 2005 ). Calpain cleaves p35 to release p25, an activating protein for the tau kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and excess calpain activation has been linked to hyperphosphorylation of tau and its subsequent aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles. In a tauopathy mouse model, genetic calpain reduction prevented neurodegeneration (see Noble et al., 2003 ; Rao et al., 2014 ). Preclinical studies with small-molecule calpain inhibitors have shown improvement of behavioral deficits in models of excitotoxicity of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, a brain area involved in AD. This effect was attributed to the inhibitor’s ability to stanch cholinergic neurodegeneration. In hippocampal slice culture, calpain inhibition reportedly prevented both excitotoxic neuronal death and deficits in neurotransmission brought on by Aβ oligomers. In rats, calpain inhibition dose-dependently protected neurons against degeneration caused by Aβ oligomers, and it prevented gliosis ( Nimmrich et al., 2008 ; Nimmrich et al., 2010 ; Granic et al., 2010 ).","Overview Name: ABT-957 Synonyms: Alicapistat Chemical Name: (2R)-1-benzyl-N-[4-(cyclopropylamino)-3,4-dioxo-1-phenylbutan-2-yl]-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxamide Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: AbbVie",discontinued,,False,,04 Nov 2022,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/abt-957

In addition, continued oxidative metabolism provides NADPH, the reducing power needed to convert oxidized glutathione to the reduced form capable of detoxifying H202 and other organic peroxides. Acetyl-CoA is also important to the biosynthesis of acetylcholine.","Overview Name: Acetyl-l-carnitine HCI Synonyms: ALCAR Therapy Type: Supplement, Dietary (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals Approved for:",discontinued,,False,,07 Nov 2018,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/acetyl-l-carnitine-hci

This vaccine grew out of work with tetrapalmitoylated preparations of N-terminal Aβ fragments, which rapidly stimulated anti-Aβ antibodies that dissolve amyloid fibers in vitro and in vivo. ACI-24 is based on the truncated Aβ-15 sequence, which is devoid of T-cell epitopes located closer to the peptide’s C-terminus. An array of Aβ1-15 sequences, sandwiched between palmitoylated lysines at either end, is anchored into the surface of liposomes in such a way that the peptides adopt an aggregated β-sheet structure, forming a conformational epitope ( Feb 2002 news ). In preclinical studies, repeated subcutaneous injection of ACI-24 into APPxPS-1 transgenic mice and into cynomolgus monkeys was reported to generate high titers of anti-Aβ IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies, which involve a non-inflammatory Th2 helper cell response. In a three-month treatment study in APPxPS-1 mice, ACI-24 reportedly decreased the concentration of insoluble Aβ40 and 42 and of soluble Aβ42; it also improved novel object recognition while prompting neither gliosis nor increases in measures of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Antisera from immunized monkeys stain human Alzheimer’s disease brain ( Muhs et al., 2007 ; Hickman et al., 2011 ). Vaccination of young APPxPS-1 mice led to local microglia activation around plaques, amyloid clearance, and fewer dystrophic neurites ( Rudan Njavro et al., 2022 ). This vaccine uses the lipid adjuvant MPLA. In a mouse model of Down's syndrome, immunization at 5 months of age elicited anti-Aβ IgG, and led to a modest reduction in brain Aβ at 8 months. Vaccination improved memory deficits, and reduced cholinergic neuron atrophy, with no signs of inflammation or hemorrhage ( Belinchenko et al., 2016 ). More recently, AC Immune tested an optimized version of ACI-24 in mice and nonhuman primates ( Vukicevic et al., 2022 ; Mar 2022 conference news ). ACI-24.060 contains additional non-Aβ peptides (e.g. tetanus) to boost helper T cell responses. The vaccine was well-tolerated. It induced high titers of IgG reactive to pyroGlu-Aβ, an N-terminally truncated and modified form of Aβ that is highly amyloidogenic and toxic. PyroGlu-Aβ is also the target of donanemab , a monoclonal antibody approved to treat AD.

No preclinical information on ACI-3024 is formally published. According to data presented at conferences, the compound disrupts tau aggregates in vitro, independent of the presence of pathogenic mutations (see March 2019 AAT-AD/PD slides). Reportedly, ACI-3024 does not cross-react with monomeric tau, or with Aβ or α-synuclein aggregates from human brain, and it disaggregates tau neurofibrillary tangles in human brain sections ex vivo, even in the presence of amyloid plaques. In cell-based assays, nanomolar concentrations of ACI-3024 were claimed to cause a dose-dependent reduction of intracellular pathological tau, and to prevent microglial activation and neuron death induced by tau paired helical filaments in primary brain cell cultures. One month of ACI-3024 treatment was claimed to reduce brain aggregated and insoluble tau in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy due to expression of mutated human tau.

The PD01A immunogen was selected by screening a library of synthetic peptides with a monoclonal antibody to α-synuclein oligomers. When used to vaccinate mice, the PD01A peptide induced antibodies that recognized α-synuclein aggregates preferentially over monomers, and did not react with β-synuclein ( Mandler et al., 2014 ).

Tau acetylation at lysine residues is associated with protein aggregation and pathology in various tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (e.g. Min et al., 2010 ; Cohen et al., 2011 ). K280 lies in a region critical for tau aggregation, and acetyl-K280 has been detected in AD and other human tauopathies ( Irwin et al., 2012 ; Wesseling et al., 2020 ). In preclinical work, an acetylated tau fragment spanning K280 was able to seed and accelerate aggregation of tau in vitro and in cells, and was more neurotoxic than the non-acetylated version. Mutational analysis suggested that K280 acetylation accounted for the enhanced toxicity. In the P301L mouse model of tau pathology, immunization with a tau 275-286 peptide, acetylated at K280, decreased the levels of phosphorylated and acetylated tau in brain, and improved cognitive and motor performance. The Y01 monoclonal antibody raised to this peptide interacted with acetylated K280 and surrounding residues in intact tau, inhibited aggregation and propagation of acetylated tau, and promoted tau uptake by microglia. The antibody detected K280-acetylated tau in human AD brain sections and CSF, and in P301L mouse brain lysates.

This lipid kinase phosphorylates signaling molecules in early endosomes that control endosomal function and fusion with lysosomes. Inhibitors of PIKfyve promote trafficking and clearance of aggregation-prone proteins via autophagy. Apilimod was originally developed for autoimmune diseases, because it blocked inflammatory cytokine production evoked by Toll-like receptor activation ( Wada et al., 2007 ). The compound progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials for Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, where doses of 50-200 mg daily were safe but lacked efficacy ( Sands et al., 2010 ; Krausz et al., 2012 ). Side effects were mild to moderate headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. After these studies, apilimod’s target was identified as PIKfyve ( Cai et al., 2013 ). Apilimod inhibits PIKfyve with an IC50 of 14 nM, and shows no activity toward other lipid or protein kinases. The interest in repurposing apilimod for ALS arose when PIKfyve inhibitors were identified in a drug screen to extend the survival of iPSC-derived motor neurons from C9ORF72 ALS patients ( Shi et al., 2018 ). In these cells, apilimod protected against neurotoxicity, and promoted clearance of toxic C9ORF72-encoded dipeptides by autophagy. In mouse models, apilimod blocked neurodegeneration and lowered levels of dipeptide protein aggregates in hippocampal neurons. It similarly rescued motor deficits in a zebrafish model of dipeptide toxicity ( de Calbiac et al., 2024 ). Apilimod increased the exocytosis of toxic aggregates of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 in C9ORF72 cells and animal models of ALS, and also in cells from sporadic cases, or cases caused by mutations in TDP-43 or FUS. In ALS mouse models, intracranial delivery of apilimod reduced pathology and extended survival ( Hung et al., 2023 ).

Blocking CCR3 is expected to have broad anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects. Alkahest acquired this molecule from Boehringer-Ingelheim; it is taken by mouth. CCR3 inhibition is of interest for age-related and neurodegenerative diseases because it is the receptor for eotaxin, aka CCL11, a chemokine implicated in cognitive decline. Blood eotaxin levels increase with age, and it was identified as a critical component of old plasma that reduces hippocampal neurogenesis and promotes cognitive decline when given to young mice ( Villeda et al., 2011 ). This chemokine freely enters the brain, and it has been shown to activate microglia ( Parajuli et al., 2015 ). Plasma eotaxin is elevated in people with neurodegenerative diseases, and multiple studies have associated higher plasma concentrations with worse cognitive function in the elderly and in people with AD (e.g., Yang et al., 2021 ; Elkind et al., 2021 ; Bettcher et al., 2016 ). Elevated plasma and brain eotaxin also have been documented in traumatic brain injury and psychiatric diseases ( Hiskins et al., 2021 ; Cherry et al., 2017 ; Teixeira et al., 2018 ). Genetic studies implicate eotaxin in Alzheimer’s disease. Variants in CCL11 can delay the onset of familial AD by up to a decade, presumably by lowering eotaxin protein levels ( Lalli et al., 2015 ; Guerreiro and Bras, 2015 ; Andrews et al., 2019 ). In aged mice, an anti-CL11 antibody was reported to benefit spatial memory; in a Parkinson's model, a different anti-CL11 antibody, administered peripherally, reduced T cell infiltration into the substantia nigra and suppressed glial cell activation there ( Scabia et al., 2021 ; Chandra et al., 2016 ). Some preclinical data on AKST4290 was presented at conferences. The drug reportedly reversed eotaxin-induced memory deficits in healthy mice. In a model of Parkinson’s disease, six weeks of treatment was claimed to improve grip strength and balance, and reduce gliosis in the striatum. AKST4290 was reported to prevent microglial activation and cognitive decline in mice given chronic low-dose lipopolysaccharide to mimic chronic inflammation ( Dec 2018 news ).","Overview Name: AKST4290 Synonyms: ALK4290, lazucirnon Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Inflammation (timeline) Condition(s): Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2) Company: Alkahest, Inc.",ongoing,2.0,False,,06 Oct 2021,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/akst4290

Sortilin is important for neurotrophin signaling, lysosomal degradation, and APP metabolism. It negatively regulates levels of the lysosomal protein progranulin. Genetic mutations that reduce levels of the progranulin protein and induce lysosome dysfunction are a leading cause of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In animal models, loss of progranulin leads to inflammation and neurodegeneration (e.g., Yin et al., 2010 ). A progranulin polymorphism is associated with risk for AD and PD ( Chen et al., 2015 ).

It comprises an anti-Aβ antibody fused with a transferrin receptor antibody that facilitates entry into the brain.,"Background ALIA-1758 is a bispecific antibody construct. It comprises an anti-Aβ antibody fused with a transferrin receptor antibody that facilitates entry into the brain. The Aβ antibody recognizes N-terminal truncated Aβ pyroglutamated at position 3, a form that is aggregated in amyloid plaques. It is similar in specificity to Lilly’s donanemab and remternetug , and ABBV-916 , which are meant to remove amyloid plaques quickly and completely. The proprietary brain delivery platform was created by Janssen scientists, and licensed to Aliada Therapeutics. It utilizes an optimized single-chain antibody to the transferrin receptor, which is fused to an Aβ antibody whose Fc sequence has reduced effector function. Binding to transferrin receptors on endothelial cells mediates transcytosis of the antibody across the blood-brain border. Once in the brain, the antibody is taken up by resident myeloid cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis through their transferrin receptors, leading to degradation of Aβ via a non-classical phagocytosis pathway. The non-functional Fc domain lessens the chance of neuroinflammation, and other changes increase antibody half-life. According to published preclinical data, a transferrin receptor antibody shuttled β-secretase enzyme into the brain in mice, resulting in reduced production of Aβ40. A tau/transferrin bispecific antibody gained widespread entry in non-human primate brain. In a mouse model of tau seeding, the antibody reduced tau aggregates, without inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines ( Edavettal et al., 2022 , and commentary by Thomsen and Moos, 2022 ).

It is an allosteric modulator of inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptors on neural stem cells and other cell types in the brain ( Luchetti et al., 2011 ). Allopregnanolone levels have been reported to be reduced in the temporal cortices of people with Alzheimer's disease and in the CSF of ALS patients ( Naylor et al., 2010 ; Lucchi et al., 2024 ). In transgenic Alzheimer's mouse models, allopregnanolone has been reported to increase neurogenesis, reduce amyloid deposition, and improve performance on learning and memory tests (e.g., Wang et al., 2010 ; Chen et al., 2011 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). The drug also has been proposed to promote neuron and oligodendrocyte maturation and improve mitochondrial function in AD mice ( Chen et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). In mouse models of the lipid storage disease Niemann-Pick Type C, restoring low allopregnanolone levels lengthened survival, a neuroprotective effect thought to be mediated by the pregnane X steroid receptor ( Sep 2006 news ). The pleiotropic effects of allopregnanolone in neurons required both the GABA-A receptor and L-type calcium channels ( Wang et al., 2023 ). The rationale behind evaluating allopregnanolone in Alzheimer's is that a combined regenerative and neuroprotective effect may counteract ongoing neuronal cell loss in this neurodegenerative disease ( Brinton and Wang, 2006 ; Brinton, 2013 ; Irwin et al., 2014 ). However, other studies have reported that allopregnanolone can impair learning function in two different AD mouse strains (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 2013 ). Newer data indicate that continuous elevation of allopregnanolone in mice worsens amyloid load and learning, while intermittent dosing has opposite, beneficial effects ( Bengtsson et al., 2020 ). Allopregnanolone levels have also been reported to be reduced in Parkinson’s disease patients ( Di Michele et al., 2003 ; Luchetti et al., 2023 ).

Originally developed by Bristol Myers Squibb as a potential treatment for schizophrenia, the compound is now in testing for AD. The rationale for this drug stems from mGluR5’s role as a co-receptor for Aβ oligomers, and a mediator of their synaptotoxcity (e.g., see Um et al., 2013 ; Hamilton et al., 2016 ). In experiments performed in the Strittmatter lab at Yale University, this compound prevented Aβ oligomer-induced mGluR5 activation and synapse loss, without affecting physiological glutamate signaling. A one-month regimen improved synapse density and function, and memory behaviors in APP/PS1 mice with amyloidosis ( Haas et al., 2017 ). The compound may work by inhibiting astrocyte-mediated synapse destruction. Pharmacokinetic studies in rodents and nonhuman primates reported nearly full occupancy of brain mGluR5 receptors after oral dosing, as judged by PET imaging with the mGluR5 ligand 18F FPEB. No toxicity resulted from doses up to 250 times higher than those needed to achieve binding to half of brain receptors.

One study conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital reported that cromolyn inhibits aggregation of Aβ monomers in vitro, and decreased soluble Aβ levels in the brains of APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice after peripheral administration in vivo ( Hori et al., 2015 ). In Tg2576 AD mice, three months’ dosing with cromolyn alone, or in combination with ibuprofen, prevented accumulation of insoluble brain Aβ42 and Aβ40. Cromolyn alone or with ibuprofen promoted microglia recruitment to plaques, and phagocytosis of β-amyloid deposits. Ibuprofen alone had no effect ( Zhang et al., 2018) . Cromolyn acted synergistically with two other drugs, bromocriptine and topiramate, to diminish Aβ42 and Aβ40 production, and the Aβ42/20 ratio, in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stems cells from Alzheimer’s patients ( Kondo et al., 2017 ).

Syrup, tablet, and other forms are used at doses of 30 to 120 mg per day to reduce or thin mucous secretions and ease sore throat pain. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal. Ambroxol is unavailable in North America. Interest in repurposing ambroxol to treat Parkinson’s disease stems from its activity as a molecular chaperone for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) ( Maegawa et al., 2009 ). Loss-of-function mutations in the GCase gene, GBA1, are the leading genetic risk factor for the synucleinopathies Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). GCase activity and α-synuclein are linked: GCase deficiency causes pathologic accumulation of α-synuclein ( Cullen et al., 2011 ), while GCase overexpression in brain reduces pathology and memory deficits in a synucleinopathy mouse model ( Sardi et al., 2011 ). GCase activity is also diminished in cases of idiopathic PD and DLB without GBA1 mutations, and lower GCase correlates with earlier disease onset and worse cognitive and non-motor symptoms ( Gegg et al., 2012 ; Chiasserini et al., 2015 ). GBA1 mutations were originally identified as the cause of parkinsonism in Gaucher’s disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the buildup of sphingolipids, and, in some cases, α-synuclein pathology ( Lwin et al, 2004 ; Mazzulli et al., 2011 ). In cells derived from patients with Gaucher’s or PD, ambroxol stabilized mutant GCase and facilitated its movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes, increasing protein levels, enzyme activity, and lysosome function ( Bendikov-Bar et al., 2013 ; McNeill et al., 2014 ). In flies with GCH1 mutations, ambroxol increased GCase activity, decreased ER stress, and protected motor function ( Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2016 ). In wild-type and GCH1-mutation-bearing mice, ambroxol induced brain GCase activity, and in mice overexpressing human α-synuclein, it decreased total and phosphorylated α-synuclein ( Migdalska-Richards et al., 2016 ). In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ambroxol improved motor function and extended survival ( Bouscary et al., 2019 ). In healthy, non-human primates, daily ambroxol increased brain GCase activity ( Migdalska-Richards et al., 2017 ).","Overview Name: Ambroxol Synonyms: Ambrosan, Mucosolvan Chemical Name: trans-4-(2-Amino-3,5-dibrombenzylamino)-cyclohexanol Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: alpha-synuclein, Other (timeline) Condition(s): Parkinson's Disease, Parkinson's Disease Dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies U.S. FDA Status: Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2), Parkinson's Disease Dementia (Phase 2), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Phase 2) Status in Select Countries: OTC for cough relief.",ongoing,2.0,False,,22 Apr 2021,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/ambroxol

Fibroblasts from a skin biopsy are converted into pluripotent stem cells and then differentiated into dopaminergic neuron precursor cells. The cells are surgically infused with MRI guidance into the putamen on both sides of the brain, where they are expected to replace dopaminergic neurons that die in Parkinson’s disease. Because the patient’s own cells make up the graft, no immune suppression is needed. The procedure for producing pluripotent stem cells and neurons was developed at Scripps Research, San Diego, California ( Boland et al., 2017 ). The technology for generating dopaminergic neurons formed the basis for the founding of Aspen Neurosciences in 2018. In preclinical work, ANPD001cells derived from two Parkinson’s disease patients were transplanted into rats with chemically induced parkinsonism ( Hills et al., 2023 ). Neuron precursors that were differentiated for 18 days, but not 25 days, could relieve motor symptoms. Both types of grafts survived and expressed dopaminergic cell markers, but only the 18-day cells supported robust neurite outgrowth, and thus integration of the cells into the host brain. Gene expression analysis defined a profile associated with efficacy in the model. As presented at meetings, Aspen Neurosciences developed quality control benchmarks based on RNA expression profiling, to guide the selection of cells for transplantation (e.g., June 2022 press release ). A company-sponsored study used non-human primates to optimize the infusion technique ( Emborg et al., 2024 ). Cynomolgus macaques received low-volume intraputaminal injections of 25 to 50 microliters over 10 to 20 minutes, using two needle tracks per side, under MRI guidance. This technique produced accurate placement of cells, which survived out to the last observation at 30 days.

Given by intravenous infusion, the antibody is in development to treat autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Besides its role in innate immunity, C1q has a function in neurodevelopment, where it marks synapses for pruning by glia. Aberrant activation of C1q in Alzheimer’s and related conditions leads to removal of healthy synapses and contributes to dementia and loss of function. Neutralizing C1q with ANX005 aims to limit complement-mediated neurodegeneration and preserve synapses. In preclinical work, ANX-M1, the murine precursor of ANX005, inhibited the classical complement cascade in vitro with an IC50 of approximately 2.5 nM, and inhibited complement activation in blood in vivo. In rats and monkeys, ANX-005 reached CSF in concentrations sufficient to bind all C1q there. Weekly intravenous administration for one month was well tolerated in rats and monkeys. No treatment-related adverse findings were observed up to 200 mg/kg, a dose 200-fold higher than the Phase 1 starting dose in healthy volunteers ( Lansita et al., 2017 ).

In September 2024, the FDA approved this formulation of the pure L-leucine isomer to treat neurologic symptoms of the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick type C in adults and children. NALL is currently in clinical trials for ataxia telangiectasia. N-acetylation of L-leucine allows the amino acid to more easily enter cells ( Churchill et al., 2021 ). The racemic mixture N-acetyl-DL-leucine has been used in France since the 1950s for the treatment of acute vertigo and dizziness, despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting its effectiveness ( Vanderkam et al., 2019 ). Anecdotal reports and case studies reporting improvements in movement, cognition, and quality of life in patients with Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) or cerebellar ataxias of varying etiologies spurred interest in repurposing this drug ( Bremova et al., 2015 ; Strupp et al., 2013 ). Other case series reported no benefit in cerebellar ataxia patients ( Pelz et al., 2015 ), or in people with multiple systems atrophy ( Scigliuolo et al., 2017 ). Additional anecdotes describe improved mobility, cognition, and mood in mentally healthy elderly people, that disappear when the drug is discontinued ( Platt and Strupp, 2016 ; Kolb, 2023 ). Symptomatic improvements and possible neuroprotection have also been reported in two people with REM sleep disorder, a prodrome of Parkinson’s disease ( Oertel et al., 2024 ; Balint and Bhatia, 2024 ), and in people with the movement disorder restless leg syndrome ( Fields et al., 2021 ). The mechanism of NALL in these conditions is unknown. Earlier preclinical work indicated that N-acetyl-DL-leucine was able to normalize activity in vestibular neurons responsible for balance. This gave rise to a theory that similarly normalizing cerebellar neuron activity could improve ataxia symptoms. In a mouse model of NPC, the L-enantiomer NALL, but not the D-version, significantly delayed the onset of gait abnormalities and motor dysfunction, slowed disease progression, reduced microgliosis, and survival ( Kaya et al., 2020 ). In a similar study of a mouse model of a lysosomal storage disease called Sandhoff’s, N-acetyl-dl-leucine improved motor function and slightly increased lifespan ( Kaya et al., 2020 ). In these models, NALL normalized glucose and glutamate metabolism, increased autophagy, increased levels of superoxide dismutase, and improved mitochondrial energy metabolism. NALL was investigated in other neurodegenerative conditions. In a mouse model of Parkinsonism, it alleviated motor deficits and was associated with neuroprotection and diminished neuroinflammation ( Xu et al., 2023 ). NALL prevented cortical cell death and neuroinflammation, and improved functional recovery, in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury ( Hegdekar et al., 2021 ).","Overview Name: AQNEURSA Synonyms: N-acetyl-L-leucine, NALL, IB1001, levacetylleucine Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Inflammation (timeline) , Other (timeline) Condition(s): Niemann-Pick Diseases, Ataxia, Lysosomal Storage Diseases, Nervous System U.S. FDA Status: Niemann-Pick Diseases (Approved), Ataxia (Phase 3), Lysosomal Storage Diseases, Nervous System (Phase 2) Company: IntraBio Approved for: Neurological symptoms of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C",approved,3.0,True,,23 Jan 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/aqneursa

This new pyrrolo-pyrimidinone was first developed for treatment of erectile dysfunction in South Korea, and is now being tested for Alzheimer’s disease. Its maker claims AR1001 to be 10-fold more potent at inhibiting PDE5, and better at entering the brain, than approved PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil. The rationale for using PDE5 inhibitors in AD stems from animal studies, where these compounds enhance memory and learning by increasing the intracellular messenger cGMP, and also possibly by improving blood supply to the brain. Several PDE5 inhibitors have been reported to curtail amyloid production, and to lessen neuroinflammation and learning and memory deficits in mouse models of AD (see review by Zuccarello et al., 2020 ). Three studies have reported PDE5 effects in people. Men being treated for erectile dysfunction with low doses of the PDE5 inhibitors tadalafil or udenafil daily for eight weeks improved performance on tests of cognition and cerebral blood flow, while a single dose of sildenafil improved brain blood supply in people with AD ( Choi et al., 2019 ; Shim et al., 2014 ; Sheng et al., 2017 ). A study of potential AD targets for drug repurposing has identified sildenafil, and a medical records analysis reported that men who used it lowered their risk of AD by 69 percent ( Fang et al. 2021 ). Other analyses found no such evidence ( Desai et al., 2022 ) The only public preclinical data on AR1001 was presented by Aribio at AAIC 2020, where the company reported reduced Aβ plaque deposition in 5XFAD mice, and improved memory in NSE/APP-C105 mice after treatment ( Kang et al., 2020 ).

In preclinical work, arimoclomol reduced symptoms and prolonged life in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by SOD1, FUS, or valosin-containing protein mutation, as well as models of spinal muscular atrophy and NPC ( Kieran et al., 2004 ; Pelaez et al., 2024 ; Ahmed et al., 2023 ; Malik et al., 2013 ; Kirkegaard et al., 2016 ). It improved the folding, location, and activity of mutated beta-glucosidase enzyme in cells derived from people with the lysosome storage disorder Gaucher disease ( Fog et al., 2018 ). The compound ameliorated cytotoxicity in cell and mouse models of inclusion body myopathy ( Guettsches et al., 2022 ; Ahmed et al., 2016 ; Mar 2016 news ). In a C. elegans model of tau toxicity, arimoclomol restored normal movement and extended lifespan, and it partially normalized NPC1 expression and lysosomal cholesterol levels in presenilin knockout cells ( Stanley et al., 2024 ; Fabiano et al., 2024 ). A nanomicelle preparation of arimoclomol was reported to have beneficial effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases ( Xavier-de-Britto et al., 2025 ).

Aripiprazole has been investigated for its effects on psychosis in patients with moderate to advanced AD, and is currently being investigated for agitation in this population. In the 1990s and early 2000s, several different atypical antipsychotics drugs were being widely prescribed to AD patients to alleviate their symptoms of psychosis and agitation, particularly in nursing homes. Soon after aripiprazole's approval, studies reported increased mortality, stroke, and faster cognitive decline, and meta-analyses reported this to be a class effect of both typical and atypical antipsychotics in this population, triggering an FDA warning (see Oct 2005 news ). This led to calls for more research on treatment options for psychosis and agitation in AD (e.g. Ballard and Corbett, 2010 ).

Increased LRRK2 expression and kinase activity impair lysosome function, promote neuroinflammation, and contribute to neurodegeneration and the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. Genetic and preclinical data also implicate LRRK2 in the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy. A so-called proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), ARV-102 is a bifunctional small molecule that binds to LRRK2 and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It mediates formation of a trimeric complex that induces ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of LRRK2. This aims to reduce kinase activity and also LRRK2’s protein-scaffolding functions. The ability to decrease LRRK2 protein levels distinguishes ARV-102 from DNL 151 , a LRRK2 kinase inhibitor in Phase 2 for Parkinson’s disease. ARV-102’s mechanism is comparable to the discontinued LLRK2 antisense oligomer ION859 . No preclinical work has been published on ARV-102. At the 2024 Michael J. Fox Foundation’s PD Therapeutics conference, a company presentation showed that the PROTAC caused degradation of LRRK2 and decreased phosphorylation of its substrate Rab10 in brain in a genetic mouse model of PD (Cacace 2024, see slides ). ARV-102 increased lysosome number and function in cells. In mouse tauopathy models, it reduced soluble tau aggregate formation. In nonhuman primates, ARV-102 given orally reduced LRRK2 levels by 83 percent or more in cortex, striatum and cerebellum, and in CSF. It normalized the lysosomal lipid bis(monoacylglycero) phosphate (BMP) in urine and CSF. A biomarker discovery program identified the inflammation marker IBA1, lysosomal marker cathepsin B, and lysosomal/inflammatory marker transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) as indicators of LRRK2 levels and activity in Parkinson’s patients. In the nonhuman primates, CSF levels of all were all reduced after a single oral dose of ARV-102. LRRK2 inhibitors have been reported to cause changes in lung tissue (e.g., Baptista et al., 2020 ; Miller et al., 2023 ).

Asceneuron was developing ASN51 as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. It is a second-generation version of its lead OGH inhibitor, ASN120290 , which is intended to treat the rare tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy. ASN51 is taken in capsule form. The rationale for targeting OGA originated in the observation that addition of N-GlcNAc to tau reduces its propensity to form toxic aggregates ( Gong et al., 2005 ; Liu et al., 2004 ). OGA inhibitors promote glycosylation, prevent aggregation, and appear to stabilize tau in a soluble, nonpathogenic form. O-GlcNAc modification was reported to reduce the aggregation and toxicity of the α-synuclein protein as well ( Marotta et al., 2015 ; Levine et al., 2019 ). This modification appears to promote formation of an α-synuclein fibril strain that does not propagate and is not neurotoxic in vivo ( Balana et al., 2024 ).Thus, OGA inhibitors could potentially slow or prevent the progression of neurodegeneration due to these proteins. No preclinical work is published on ASN51. However, Asceneuron has published data on ASN90 , their first-generation OGA inhibitor in development for the primary tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy. In the P301S mouse model of tauopathy, daily oral dosing enhanced brain tau glycosylation, prevented the development of tau tangles, improved motor behavior and breathing, and increased survival ( Permanne et al., 2022 ). In this study, tau glycosylation in peripheral blood cells mirrored modification in the CNS, and thus was suggested as a potential pharmacodynamic marker of OGA inhibition for clinical trials. Also in this work, ASN90 was shown to enhance α-synuclein glycosylation, and slow the progression of motor impairment in a transgenic model of Parkinson’s disease. A different OGA inhibitor, thiamet G, has also been reported to increase glycosylated tau, reduce tau neurofibrillary tangle numbers, and decrease neuronal cell loss in three different mouse strains expressing P301L mutant human tau ( Yuzwa et al., 2012 ; Graham et al., 2014 ; Hastings et al., 2017 ). One lab found that thiamet G treatment resulted in better motor skills, higher body weight, and longer lifespan ( Borghgraef et al., 2013 ). Thiamet G or OGA knockdown was also shown to reduce the uptake of synuclein fibrils by cells ( Tavassoly et al., 2020 ).

It is being investigated as a treatment for tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. ATB2005A is claimed to be brain-penetrant. ATB2005A is an example of an autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTOTAC) that stimulates lysosomal degradation of proteins by activating the p62/SQSTM1 receptor. AUTOTACs have been shown to promote the degradation of multiple pathologic protein aggregates, including mutant P301L tau ( Ji et al., 2022 ).

Known as gingipains, these proteases penetrate gingival tissue and cause inflammation at the site of periodontitis ( O'Brien-Simpson et al., 2009 ). Periodontitis has been linked epidemiologically to cognitive impairment, and P. gingivalis bacterial lipopolysaccharide has been detected in postmortem brain tissue of people with AD ( Poole et al., 2013 ). Oral P. gingivalis has been called a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease ( Kanagasingam et al., 2020 ). Cortexyme’s approach is based on the theory that P. gingivalis invades the brain, where gingipains contribute to Alzheimer’s pathology (see Sabbagh and Decourt, 2022 ). The company reported elevated gingipain in brain tissue from people with AD, and a correlation between levels of gingipain and tau proteins in postmortem middle temporal gyrus from AD and healthy control tissue. P. gingivalis DNA was detected in postmortem cortices from people with AD and healthy controls, and in CSF of AD patients ( Jan 2019 news on Dominy et al., 2019 ). In the same study, they show that in mice, oral P. gingivalis infection led to the appearance of bacterial DNA in the brain, increased brain Aβ42 production, neuroinflammation, and hippocampal degeneration. The first three findings were reported to be reduced by atuzaginstat; results for hippocampal cell death were not reported. In preclinical work from other labs, infection with P. gingivalis was reported to worsen AD pathology and cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice, and to cause neuroinflammation, memory impairment, neurodegeneration, micro- and astrogliosis, increased brain Aβ and phospho-tau, and neurofibrillary tangles in wild-type C57Bl6 mice ( Ishida et al., 2017 ; Ilievski et al., 2018 ; Ding et al., 2018 ). For a review of the preclinical literature, see Costa et al., 2021 . In human neurons grown in culture, P. gingivalis infection led to tau phosphorylation and degradation, synapse loss, and cell death ( Haditsch et al., 2020 ). P. gingivalis is associated with cardiovascular disease. In rabbits, oral infection was reported to increase arterial plaque and levels of the inflammatory marker CRP. Both were reversed by treatment with COR388 ( 2020 AAIC abstract ). In aged dogs with periodontal disease, ninety days of COR388 reduced oral bacterial load and gum pathology ( Arastu-Kapur et al., 2020 ).

This vaccine fuses coding sequences of three copies of Aβ1-11 to 12 T-cell-activating epitopes.,"Background AV-1959D is an NIH-funded DNA vaccine designed to elicit antibodies to Aβ peptides without activating potentially harmful autoreactive T cells. This vaccine fuses coding sequences of three copies of Aβ1-11 to 12 T-cell-activating epitopes. They include a synthetic pan-T cell antigen, antigens derived from Tetanus toxin, and from the hepatitis B and influenza viruses. The foreign antigens function to boost antibody responses by activating memory and helper T cells. This is important in old people in who tend to mount weaker responses to vaccines. AV-1959D grew out of a years-long optimization process that began with identification of Aβ1-11 as the dominant B-cell epitope in Aβ peptides, followed by preclinical testing of peptide and DNA vaccines combining this epitope with increasing numbers of T-cell epitopes. Early versions of the vaccine were reported to prevent or reverse plaque accumulation in mouse amyloidosis models, without triggering T cell infiltration in the brain ( Movsesyan et al., 2008 ; Petrushina et al., 2007 ). In mice, rabbits, and nonhuman primates, electroporation of AV-1959D or similar constructs induced strong Aβ antibody responses ( Davtyan et al., 2014 ; Davtyan et al., 2014 ; Ghochikyan et al., 2013 ). AV-1959LR is an mRNA version of the vaccine encapsulated in lipid-based nanoparticles; it generated high-titer Aβ antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates ( Hovakimyan et al., 2024 ). In preclinical safety studies in mice, the vaccine persisted at the injection site for up to two months, but did not travel to distant tissues. No toxicities or ARIA-like reactions were observed in mice with cerebral amyloid angiopathy Tg-Sw-DI mice. The vaccine induced no T- or B-cell infiltration or glial activation in brain, and did not worsen CAA or cause neurodegeneration ( Petrushina et al., 2020 ). The same platform, called MultiTEP, was used to produce recombinant protein or DNA vaccines to tau and α-synuclein, and α-synuclein, pyroglutamate-modified Aβ, and a dual Aβ/tau vaccine ( ( Hovakimyan et al., 2022 ; Kim et al., 2022 ; Zagorski et al., 2023 ; Davtyan et al., 2019 ).

It fuses three copies of a tau2-18 peptide to 12 T-cell activating antigens. This MultiTep vaccine platform includes a synthetic pan-T cell antigen, as well as antigens derived from Tetanus toxin, hepatitis B, and influenza virus. The foreign antigens function to boost antibody responses to the tau peptide by activating memory and helper T cells, while avoiding stimulation of potentially harmful autoreactive T cells. This is important in older people, who tend to mount weaker responses to vaccines. The vaccine is formulated with the adjuvant AdvaxCpG55.2. This vaccine targets a different tau epitope than did previous, failed N-terminal directed tau antibodies ( Nov 2022 conference news ). The tau2-18 peptide includes tau’s so-called phosphatase activation domain, which is hidden in normally folded tau, and becomes exposed once tau starts to aggregate ( Combs et al., 2016 ; Combs and Kanaan, 2017 ). In preclinical work, AV-1980R/A induced high antibody titers in mice ( Davtyan et al., 2016 ). Antibodies from vaccinated PS19 tau transgenic mice recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections, and nondenatured tau from AD brain ( Hovakimyan et al., 2019 ). Vaccination prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in the PS19 mice, and significantly reduced insoluble and phosphorylated tau species in brain. In the Tg4510 tau mouse model, immunization induced strong antibody responses, and detectable IgG in brain. These animals had improvement in short-term memory, but not in other behavioral tasks. Antibodies reduced pSer396 tau, but not other phosphorylated species, in brain ( Joly-Amado et al., 2020 ). In nonhuman primates, the vaccine elicited antibodies that recognized pathological tau tangles and tau-positive neurites in sections from AD brain without staining sections from non-AD brain, supporting human trials ( Hovakimyan et al., 2022 ). A DNA version of AV-1980 produced high titer antibodies, with no evidence of autoreactive T cell responses in THY-Tau22 mice ( Davtyan et al., 2017 ). Vaccination reduced brain total tau and some forms of phosphorylated tau in the mice. The MultiTEP platform is being used to develop other vaccines for neurodegenerative diseases. The Aβ vaccine AV-1959D is currently in Phase 1. Vaccines to α-synuclein, and a dual Aβ/tau vaccine are also being developed ( Kim et al., 2022 ; Davtyan et al., 2019 ).",Overview Name: AV-1980R/A Synonyms: AV-1980R Therapy Type: Immunotherapy (active) (timeline) Target Type: Tau (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1),ongoing,1.0,False,,21 Nov 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/av-1980ra

It is being tested in people with frontotemporal dementia due to pathogenic progranulin mutations.,"Background AVB-101 is a gene therapy designed to deliver a copy of the human progranulin gene to the brain. It is being tested in people with frontotemporal dementia due to pathogenic progranulin mutations. These patients have abnormally low expression of progranulin in the brain, and the goal of this gene therapy is to restore progranulin concentration and function. AVB-101 is derived from a non-replicating adeno-associated virus, serotype 9 (AAV-9), modified to contain a copy of the non-mutated human PGRN gene under control of a neuron-specific promoter. Thus, the tropism of the virus and gene construction are designed to restrict expression to neurons. The treatment is given as a one-time infusion into the thalamus, using MRI-guided stereotactic surgery. Thalamic delivery is intended to maximize distribution to multiple areas of the cortex via the brain’s extensive thalamo-cortical neural network. No preclinical work is published on AVB-101. At conferences, the company has shown data indicating that thalamic delivery in progranulin knockout mice re-established protein expression and reversed phenotypes of lysosome dysfunction and neuroinflammation. The company reported that MRI-guided thalamic infusion in sheep and monkeys produced broad brain expression of human progranulin. Thalamic infusion was claimed to give wider distribution and higher expression at lower viral doses compared to delivery by injection into the CSF of the cisterna magna. In monkeys, progranulin concentrations reached physiological levels in the frontal and temporal lobes that are most affected in FTD. The treatment caused no overt toxicity in the animals. The monkeys developed low-grade microgliosis in the thalamus and midbrain, which was more pronounced at higher doses and increased over six months. No progranulin expression and little viral material was found outside the brain ( 2022 slides ; 2022 poster ; 2023 poster ).",Overview Name: AVB-101 Therapy Type: DNA/RNA-based Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Frontotemporal Dementia U.S. FDA Status: Frontotemporal Dementia (Phase 1/2) Company: AviadoBio,ongoing,1.0,False,,02 Jul 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/avb-101

It is approved in the U.S. and many other countries for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and severe COVID, approved in Japan and Europe but not yet the U.S. for atopic dermatitis, and used for alopecia areata. Baricitinib suppresses the immune system and reduces inflammation by interfering with cytokine signaling induced via the JAK/STAT, i.e., signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway. The repurposing of baricitinib for neurodegeneration rests on studies from Massachusetts General Hospital that uncovered a role for JAK-mediated innate immunity in neuronal cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In cells bearing the causative c9ORF72 gene hexanucleotide expansions, double-stranded RNA products of the expanded repeats triggered the Type I interferon inflammatory response, which caused neuron death. Baricitinib or other FDA-approved JAK inhibitors blocked this interferon response and rescued cell death ( July 2021 news ). In a separate study, the same investigators identified baricitinib as a candidate for repurposing for Alzheimer disease, based on a computational biology analysis of gene expression changes in AD brain, and reversal of these changes in drug-treated cells ( Rodriguez et al., 2021 ). Baricitinib carries box warnings for increased risk of serious infections, cancer, major cardiovascular events, blood clots, and death.

Taken orally, benfotiamine produces supra-physiological blood levels of the active coenzyme form of thiamine. This supplement is available by prescription in some countries, and over the counter in the U.S. and other places. It is used to treat diabetic neuropathy at doses of 150-300 mg per day. Thiamine-dependent enzymes function in glucose metabolism. Thiamine deficiency, and reduced activity of thiamine-dependent enzymes in the brain, have been documented in Alzheimer's disease patients (e.g. Gibson et al., 1998 ). This deficiency has been related to changes in brain glucose metabolism and cognitive function ( Sang et al., 2018 ). Earlier trials of high-dose conventional thiamine demonstrated little or no benefit on cognition (e.g. Meador et al., 1993 ). A pilot trial of benfotiamine in five people with Alzheimer’s reported an increase of 3.2 points on the MMSE after 18 months of 300 mg daily, but it lacked a placebo group for comparison ( Pan et al., 2016 ). Preclinical work from two different groups showed that increasing thiamine to very high levels using benfotiamine supplementation diminished pathology, was neuroprotective, and improved behavior deficits in mouse models of amyloidosis and tauopathy ( Pan et al., 2010 ; Tapias et al., 2018 ). In toxin-induced parkinsonism models, benfotiamine was neuroprotective and improved behavior and movement ( Wang et al., 2024 ; Bashir et al., 2024 ). Benfotiamine and related thiamine prodrugs have antiinflammatory and antioxidant actions, which have been suggested to be independent of their function as coenzymes (reviewed in Bettendorff 2023 ).

It binds the mRNA for ataxin-2 and mediates its degradation, which results in lower ataxin-2 protein levels. BIIB105 was being developed to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The rationale for targeting ataxin-2 in ALS is twofold. First, polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase carriers' risk for ALS. Second, work in yeast and fly models found that ataxin-2 promotes aggregation and toxicity of the TDP-43 protein ( Elden et al., 2010 ). TDP-43 pathology is seen in almost all cases of ALS and is considered a common endpoint in both genetic and sporadic forms of the disease. Thus, decreasing ataxin-2 expression with an ASO could potentially benefit most people with ALS. In contrast, other ASOs in development for ALS target inherited mutations in SOD1 ( tofersen ), C9ORF72 ( BIIB078 ), or FUS ( ION363 ) and, as such, are applicable only to the minority of patients with those genetic causes. In preclinical work, an ataxin-2 ASO made at Ionis extended survival and improved motor function in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy ( Becker et al., 2017 ). The ASO also delayed onset of symptoms and improved motor function in a mouse model of spinal cerebellar ataxia caused by polyglutamine expansion of the ataxin-2 gene ( Scoles et al., 2017 ; Scoles and Pulst, 2018 ).","Overview Name: BIIB105 Synonyms: ION541 Therapy Type: DNA/RNA-based Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis U.S. FDA Status: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Discontinued) Company: Biogen, IONIS Pharmaceuticals",discontinued,,False,,20 May 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/biib105

OGA inhibitors promote glycosylation of tau, which prevents its aggregation and appears to stabilize the protein in a soluble, non-pathogenic form (e.g., see Yuzwa et al., 2012 ). O-GlcNAc modification was reported to reduce the aggregation and toxicity of the α-synuclein protein as well ( Marotta et al., 2015 ; Levine et al., 2019 ). This modification appears to promote formation of an α-synuclein fibril strain that does not propagate and is not neurotoxic in vivo ( Balana et al., 2024 ). Thus, OGA inhibitors could potentially slow or prevent the progression of neurodegeneration due to these proteins. Biogen is developing this inhibitor to treat Alzheimer’s disease. No preclinical work on BIIB113 is published.

Early in AD, disruption of circadian cycles, including sleep, is thought to contribute to the accumulation of amyloid, and subsequent cognitive decline.

In their studies, intraperitoneal administration activated brain PKCε and prevented synaptic loss, Aβ accumulation, and memory decline in Alzheimer’s disease transgenic mice ( Etcheberrigaray et al., 2004 ; Hongpaisan et al., 2011 ). The drug preserved synapses and improved memory in aged rats, and in rodent models of stroke and Fragile X syndrome ( Hongpaisan et al., 2013 ; Sun et al., 2008 ; Sun et al., 2016 ). In a different lab, bryostatin given by mouth improved memory and learning in an AD model ( Schrott et al., 2015 ). In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, bryostatin promoted anti-inflammatory immune responses and improved neurologic deficits ( Kornberg et al., 2018 ).

It is designed to maximize CNS exposure and minimize peripheral activity, to reduce off-target and systemic effects. It is being developed to treat Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2, also known as Dardarin, is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity. Kinase-activating LRRK2 mutations cause a rare, inherited form of Parkinson’s disease, and more common variants in the gene are associated with a higher risk of PD. Increased LRRK2 kinase activity impairs vesicle trafficking and lysosome function, and promotes neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to PD pathology (e.g., Taylor and Alessi, 2020 ; Shutinoski et al., 2019 ; Sep 2018 news ). For these reasons, LRRK2 has been aggressively pursued as a drug target, and many inhibitors have been synthesized (for reviews, see Dang et al., 2025 ; Taymans et al., 2023 ). By way of target validation, small molecule inhibitors or genetic knockdown of LRRK2 have been shown to reduce α-synuclein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuron loss ( Daher et al., 2014 ; Daher et al., 2015 ; Ho et al., 2022 ; Ho et al., 2022 ). In a mouse model of LRRK2 mutation-associated PD, three months of inhibitor treatment restored neuroprotective functions to striatal neurons and astrocytes ( Jaimon et al., 2025 ). Inhibitors also promoted physiological tetramerization and synaptic localization of α-synuclein ( Fonseca-Ornales et al., 2022 ; Brzozowski et al., 2021 ). In animal and cell models of Aβ42 toxicity, other LRRK2 inhibitors attenuated neuroinflammation ( Mutti et al., 2023 ; Filippini et al., 2023 ). Kinase inhibitors may have unacceptable side effects, as they have been reported to cause changes in lung cell morphology in rodents and nonhuman primates (e.g., Baptista et al., 2020 ; Bryce et al., 2021 ). No preclinical work is published on BT-267. At meetings in 2023 and 2024, the company presented animal data claiming a high CSF to plasma ratio, evidence of LRRK2 inhibition in brain, and no visible lung or kidney morphological changes at the highest doses tested ( press release ).

Both compounds derive from the intramural research program at NIH and were licensed to Axonyx, Inc., which developed both enantiomers into the clinic. Axonyx merged with Torrey Pines Therapeutics, which licensed posiphen to QR Pharma in 2008. Both posiphen and phenserine reduce production of amyloid precursor protein by blocking translation of its mRNA ( Shaw et al., 2001 ). Phenserine also inhibits acetylcholinesterase, while posiphen does not. Both are dosed by mouth and enter the brain. Posiphen and phenserine are considered separate therapeutics, as there is no chiral switching between the two, or between their metabolites. Posiphen and phenserine, and their respective metabolites, differ in their pharmacokinetics. They share a number of common actions and, additionally, have separate actions. Posiphen and phenserine act on iron-response element sequences in the 5' untranslated region of APP mRNA to inhibit APP protein synthesis. They reduced APP and Aβ in neuronal cultures and brains of wild-type and AD transgenic mice ( Lahiri et al., 2007 ; Marutle et al., 2007 ). Both drugs were reported to be neuroprotective and neurotrophic in AD mouse models ( Lilja et al., 2013 ; Lilja et al., 2013 ), and posiphen was reported to normalize memory impairment, learning, and synaptic function ( Teich et al., 2018 ). Posiphen was also tested in the APP-overexpressing Ts65DN mouse model of Down's syndrome, where 50 mg/kg for 26 days lowered expression of APP and its C-terminal fragments, corrected deficits in axonal transport, and normalized neurotrophin signaling ( Chen et al., 2021 ). Posiphen and phenserine reportedly also block translation of α-synuclein mRNA, implying potential application in Parkinson’s disease ( Rogers et al., 2011 ; Mikkilineni et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2013 ). Posiphen reduced α-synuclein expression in brain and gut, and improved intestinal function in the A53T α-synuclein transgenic mouse model of PD ( Kuo et al., 2019 ).

It is approved to treat acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in people under medical supervision. Currently, BXCL501 is being tested to treat agitation in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Dexmedetomidine given intravenously is commonly used for sedation and anesthesia in surgical and intensive care patients. It is also used by veterinarians to sedate cats, dogs, and horses. BioXcel Therapeutics developed BXCL501 to improve oral bioavailability of the drug. It comes in doses of 120 and 180 micrograms on a rectangular film containing 2 microdeposits of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride. After application, dexmedetomidine is absorbed into the blood stream in five to 20 minutes, where it has a half-life of 2.8 hours. In 2022, the FDA approved BXCL501 for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, after trials showed significant reduction in agitation 20 to 30 minutes after administration ( Citrome et al., 2022 ; Preskorn et al., 2022 ). Common side effects include sleepiness, numbness or pricking feelings in the mouth, dry mouth, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Users self-administer the drug in the presence of a health care professional who can monitor vital signs and alertness to prevent falls or fainting. It may interact with, and enhance the effects of, other sedatives and β-blockers. In animal models of amyloid toxicity, dexmedetomidine has been claimed to be neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory (e.g. Ma et al., 2024 ; Lian et al., 2024 ; many earlier papers). Previously, α2 adrenergic agonists were reported to promote non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein ( Nizari et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, dexmedetomidine was shown to increase tau phosphorylation and promote tau aggregation in human Tau expressing mice ( Whittington et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2015 ). As a sedative, dexmedetomidine has been reported to be associated with less delirium in intubated patients compared to lorazepam or midazolam ( Pandharipande et al., 2007 ; Riker et al., 2009 ).","Overview Name: BXCL501 Synonyms: Dexmedetomidine sublingual film, IGALMI™ Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 3) Company: BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc.

Approved in 1997, the drug is available in generic form. The most common side effects are dizziness and headache. Candesartan crosses the blood-brain barrier. Managing hypertension with medications reduces the risk of mild cognitive impairment ( Jan 2019 news ). Candesartan and other angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) act on the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure in the body and brain. Angiotensin II receptors also mediate inflammation, blood-brain barrier maintenance, and neuron survival. Genetic, epidemiologic, and biological evidence implicates changes in the brain renin-angiotensin system in Alzheimer’s disease (reviewed in Kehoe 2018 ). ARB use is associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD (e.g., Wharton et al., 2015 ; Barthold et al., 2018 ; also see Walker et al., 2020 ). In people with mild cognitive impairment, use of ARBs, but not other antihypertensives, is linked to lower brain amyloid load and CSF tau ( Hajjar et al., 2012 ; Hajjar et al., 2015 ). In another study, use of ARBs was associated with slower amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal, amyloid positive people, but not in those with mild cognitive impairment or dementia ( Ouk et al., 2021 ). Preclinical work in models of chronic hypertension, stroke, kidney disease, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction support the idea that candesartan acts in the brain to attenuate brain inflammation and cognitive impairment, independent of its effect on blood pressure ( Ahmed et al., 2018 ; Ahmed et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2014 ). In one AD mouse model, the ARB losartan improved memory and reduced plaque load ( Wang et al., 2007 ), though in a similar model, candesartan reduced neuroinflammation but failed to reduce amyloid plaque or improve cognitive function ( Trigiani et al., 2018 ). In 5XFAD mice, intranasal candesartan reduced brain inflammation and reduced amyloid burden by increasing Aβ uptake into microglia; this study did not assess cognition ( Torika et al., 2018 ). A study of mice expressing human APOE4, with or without high Aβ, found candesartan improved memory and hippocampal inflammation in females, but not males ( Scheinman et al., 2021 ).","Overview Name: Candesartan Synonyms: Atacand, Candesartan cilexetil Chemical Name: 2-ethoxy-1-({4-[2-(2H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl]phenyl}methyl)-1H-1,3-benzodiazole-7-carboxylic acid Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Mild Cognitive Impairment (Phase 2), Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2) Company: AstraZeneca, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Approved for: Hypertension, congestive heart failure",ongoing,2.0,False,,07 Nov 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/candesartan

It is structurally related to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but does not produce a high. CBD is also abundant in hemp plants, which have little to no THC, making industrial hemp the usual source of THC-free CBD oil. In many locales, hemp-derived CBD is not subject to cannabis laws, and is freely available as capsules, drops or oil suspensions, or in transdermal patches, topical lotions, or salves. CBD has been studied in clinical trials for anxiety, addiction, cognition, movement disorders, pain, and other conditions, with no strong evidence yet for its effectiveness. Nonetheless, it is widely promoted and used for these and other maladies. In 2018, an oral solution of CBD was approved in the U.S. to treat rare forms of severe childhood epilepsy. Common side effects include sleepiness, poor sleep, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and fatigue. This formulation can also cause an increase in liver enzymes, and interferes with metabolism of other medications. Like the THC formulations nabilone and dronabinol , in Alzheimer's, CBD is mainly being evaluated for treatment of agitation and aggression with this disease. In preclinical work, extensive studies with CBD in cell and animal models of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity found it had multiple actions on Aβ production, tau phosphorylation and aggregation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurogenesis (reviewed by Watt and Karl, 2017 ; also see Khodadadi et al., 2021 ). A combination of CBD and THC was reported to preserve memory function and reduced astrogliosis and inflammation in APP/PS1 mice, with the combination more effective than either alone ( Aso et al., 2015 ). CBD is reportedly neuroprotective in models of tauopathy and stroke (e.g. see Kreilaus et al., 2022 ; Ceprian et al., 2017 ). CBD’s mechanism of action is unclear. It has low affinity for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2; instead, it has been proposed to act through TRPV cation channels, the peroxisome proliferation receptor gamma (PPARγ), novel G protein coupled receptors, and serotonin receptors (reviewed by Vitale et al., 2021 ).

The peptide does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It is administered directly into the brain via a surgically implanted delivery device. Unlike other neurotrophic factors, CDNF is not a secreted protein. It is found mainly in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells. Studies suggest it regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway that contributes to ER stress and cell death in multiple neurodegenerative proteinopathies (reviewed in Huttunen and Saarma, 2019 ). CDNF knockout mice show age-dependent deficits in dopamine function in the brain and loss of enteric dopamine neurons, both of which occur in the early stages of PD ( Lindahl et al., 2020 ). Extensive preclinical work on CDNF has been done in the laboratory where it was discovered. In rodent models of toxin-induced dopaminergic cell loss, single intracerebral doses or chronic brain infusion of CDNF were reported to improve motor function and neuron survival and function ( Lindholm et al., 2007 ; Voutilainen et al., 2011 ; Airavaara et al., 2012 ). CDNF also enhanced the therapeutic benefit of acute subthalamic deep-brain stimulation (DBS), a current treatment for PD, in a rat model of late-stage disease ( Huotarinen et al., 2018 ). The same group, as well as independent investigators, published data on a gene-therapy approach. Using viral vectors to express CDNF in the striatum protected neurons and improved motor behaviors in the 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity model of parkinsonism in rats ( Bäck et al., 2013 ; Ren et al., 2013 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). CDNF was reported to inhibit α-synuclein oligomer toxicity in cultured dopaminergic neurons ( Latge et al., 2015 ). No data are published on CDNF in α-synuclein animal models. In 6-OHDA-lesioned marmoset monkeys, CDNF treatment increased dopamine transporter (DAT) binding activity on PET scans, suggesting it protected dopaminergic neurons ( Garea-Rodríguez et al., 2016 ). In other disease models, CDNF improved memory in both APP/PS1 and wild-type mice after intrahippocampal injections of the peptide or gene therapy with a viral vector. Treatment caused no change in amyloid load or hippocampal neurogenesis in the AD mice ( Kemppainen et al., 2015 ).

O-GlcNAcylation, i.e., addition of N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues, is a post-translational modification that regulates the function of many proteins. In particular, N-GlcNAcylation of tau reduces its propensity to form toxic aggregates ( Gong et al., 2005 ; Liu et al., 2004 ). OGA catalyzes removal of O-GlcNAc. OGA inhibitors promote tau glycosylation, prevent aggregation, and appear to stabilize tau in a soluble, nonpathogenic form. In preclinical work in three different mutant human-tau-expressing transgenic mice, the OGA inhibitor thiamet G was reported to increase N-GlcNAc-modified tau, reduce the number of tau neurofibrillary tangles, and decrease neuronal cell loss in three different mouse strains expressing P301L mutant human tau ( Yuzwa et al., 2012 ; Graham et al., 2014 ; Hastings et al., 2017 ). One lab found that thiamet G treatment resulted in better motor skills, higher body weight, and longer lifespan ( Borghgraef et al., 2013 ).

This modification appears to promote formation of an α-synuclein fibril strain that does not propagate and is not neurotoxic in vivo ( Balana et al., 2024 ). Thiamet G or OGA knockdown reduced the uptake of synuclein fibrils by cells ( Tavassoly et al., 2020 ). Fibril uptake is a proposed mechanism for the spread of tau pathology in the brain.

It is a chiral molecule that exists as two enantiomers.,"Background Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat depression and anxiety. It is a chiral molecule that exists as two enantiomers. Citalopram consists of a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers. A purified (S)-isomer formulation, marketed as Escitalopram, is approved to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Both are available as generics. Both work by increasing serotonin activity in the brain. Escitalopram is considered superior at treating depression, with faster onset at lower doses than citalopram ( Lepola et al., 2004 ; Gartlehner et al., 2011 ). Side effects in older adults include abnormal heart rhythm, loss of coordination, and bleeding. Many people with Alzheimer’s disease have noncognitive symptoms, which add to their and caregivers’ burdens. Agitation, including disruptive or aggressive behaviors, may stem from degeneration of serotonin systems. No treatments are approved for agitation in people with Alzheimer’s disease, but based on existing clinical evidence, citalopram and escitalopram are sometimes used ( Aga 2019 ; Kales et al., 2019 ). Some research has suggested anti-amyloid actions for SSRIs. Activation of certain serotonin receptors reduces Aβ production by increasing non-amyloidogenic α-secretase processing of APP ( Nitsch et al., 1996 ; Fisher et al., 2016 ). Citalopram was reported to lower Aβ production and amyloid plaque load in mice and people ( Cirrito et al., 2011 ; Sheline et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018 ). However, in one study, escitalopram did not reduce brain Aβ in mice ( von Linstow et al., 2017 ). More recently, escitalopram was found to increase hippocampal α-secretase activity by 50 percent, and reduce brain interstitial Aβ42 in mice ( Cirrito et al., 2020 ). The same study showed chronic escitalopram halted plaque growth, but did not remove established plaques. In cognitively normal older people, two or eight weeks of treatment with escitalopram led to a 6 percent reduction in CSF Aβ42 concentrations, compared to a slight increase in placebo-treated volunteers ( Sheline et al., 2020 ). In ADNI participants with a history of depression, long-term use of SSRIs was linked to a three-year delay in progression to dementia ( Bartels et al., 2018 ). Another study linked SSRI use in people with depression and MCI or AD to slowed cognitive decline, reduced progression of gray-matter atrophy, and a trend toward slower amyloid deposition ( Brendel et al., 2018 ). A retrospective review of medical records of 14,269 people with MCI in New York found that use of citalopram or escitalopram was associated with a significant slowing of progression to dementia ( Xu et al., 2023 ).","Overview Name: Citalopram Synonyms: escitalopram, Celexa, Lexapro , Cipralex Chemical Name: (RS)-1-[3-(Dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other Neurotransmitters (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 3), Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (Inactive) Approved for: Depression, generalized anxiety disorder",ongoing,3.0,True,,15 Aug 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/citalopram

A one-time epidemic of subacute-myelo-optico-neuropathy in Japan prompted its removal or restrictions on its use in many countries. Topical clioquinol remains in clinical use for certain fungal and other skin disorders. Clioquinol is a hydroxyquinoline ionophore that acts as a zinc and copper chelator ( Bareggi and Cornelli, 2012 ). Clioquinol has been explored as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease because it is a metal protein-attenuating compound. MPACs have been reported to disrupt the interaction between metals and the Aβ peptide in the brain. According to scientists at Prana, increasing bioactive metal levels in the aging brain accelerate formation of amyloid plaques as well as neurotoxic oxidative processes. The rationale of evaluating clioquinol was that it would prevent Aβ accumulation while restoring copper and zinc ion homoeostasis in cells. For example, clioquinol was reported to cut brain amyloid deposition in half in a mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis ( Cherny et al., 2001 ).","Overview Name: Clioquinol Synonyms: iodochlorhydroxyquin, PBT-1 Chemical Name: 5-chloro-7-iodo-quinolin-8-ol Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) , Metals Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: Prana Biotechnology Limited",discontinued,,False,,16 Oct 2014,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/clioquinol

Sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea cause sleep fragmentation and nighttime hypoxia. People with Alzheimer’s have high rates of insomnia and other sleep disorders (e.g., Cooke et al., 2006 ). Beyond making them sleepy during the day, these sleep disorders are thought to worsen their cognitive impairment. Sleep-disordered breathing has been linked to cerebrospinal fluid and brain-imaging biomarker changes that predict Alzheimer's dementia, raising the question of whether hypoxia-inducing sleep disorders are a contributor to or a consequence of AD pathogenesis ( Osorio et al., 2014 ; Osorio et al., 2014 ; Daulatzai 2013 ). In general, human and animal model research is implicating sleep more broadly in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., May 2014 conference story ; Aug 2012 conference story ). CPAP is standard treatment for sleep-disordered breathing and sleep apnea. The rationale of testing CPAP at various stages of Alzheimer’s disease is twofold: to test whether continuous brain oxygenation during sleep delays the deterioration of memory and other existing symptoms of Alzheimer’s and related dementias, and to see whether improving brain oxygenation during sleep might even have a mechanistic effect on the underlying neurodegeneration.",Overview Name: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Synonyms: CPAP Therapy Type: Procedural Intervention Target Type: Unknown Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 3) Approved for: Sleep Apnea in US,ongoing,3.0,True,,25 Sep 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/continuous-positive-airway-pressure

ABCA1 transfers lipids to ApoE, and thus facilitates clearance of amyloid peptides from the brain. Loss-of-function variants in the ABCA1 gene are associated with low plasma levels of ApoE, and a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease ( Holstege et al., 2022 ; Nordestgaard et al., 2015 ). The company is developing CS6253 for ApoE4-driven Alzheimer’s disease. Designed to mimic sequences at the carboxy terminus of ApoE, CS96253 was shown to enhance ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux from cells and formation of HDL particles in vitro ( Hafiane et al., 2015 ; Hafiane et al., 2019 ). This peptide was initially pursued for its potential to improve or prevent cardiovascular disease. In mice expressing the human AD risk gene ApoE4, CS6253 was reported to reverse hypo-lipidation of E4, slow Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons, and improve synaptic and cognitive function ( Boehm-Cagan et al., 2016 ). In the same mice, it restored blood lipoproteins to normal levels, and countered the ApoE4-induced lysosomal degradation of ABCA1 ( Boehm-Cagan et al., 2016 ; Rawat et al., 2019 ). In contrast, when tested in 5XFAD mice expressing either human ApoE3 or E4, CS6253 reduced Aβ pathology and improved memory only in young male E3 mice, the group with the least AD pathology ( Valencia-Olvera et al., 2023 ). The drug had no effect on young male E4 mice, young females, or older mice of either sex. Intravenous injection of CS6253 in monkeys transiently increased plasma ApoE and Aβ42/40 ( Noveir et al., 2022 ). In other models, CS62523 was neuroprotective in fruit flies expressing a human ApoE4 gene ( Moulton et al., 2021 ). It induced insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance in mice with diet-induced obesity ( Azhar et al., 2019 ).

Clenbuterol is related to common asthma drugs such as albuterol but is not approved for use in the U.S.","Background CST-103 is CuraSen’s name for clenbuterol, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Clenbuterol is related to common asthma drugs such as albuterol but is not approved for use in the U.S. It is abused by athletes and others for its steroid-like actions, to increase muscle mass, and for weight loss. Its repurposing for neurological disorders stems from its ability to activate norepinephrine receptors in the brain, in an effort to compensate for the loss of this neurotransmitter in neurodegenerative diseases. The sole source of brain norepinephrine is the locus coeruleus, and those neurons die early in AD and PD (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2021 ). Multiple lines of research implicate the loss of norepinephrine in the progression of AD and PD pathology and symptoms (e.g., Dec 2010 conference news ). β2-adrenergic agonists were reported to suppress α-synuclein expression, show neuroprotective effects, and be associated epidemiologically with lower PD incidence ( Sep 2017 news ). Clenbuterol likewise reduced synucleinopathy, mitochondrial damage, and memory deficits in mice with post-surgical cognitive deficits ( Li et al., 2021 ). In aged mice, the β2 agonist mabuterol decreased inflammation in the hippocampus and locus coeruleus, and improved learning and memory ( Evans et al., 2021 ). A more recent study found clenbuterol had only a transient effect on α-synuclein mRNA, and no effect on protein levels in mice ( Patterson et al., 2022 ). Clenbuterol was reported to reduce microglia activation, immune cell infiltration, and dopamine neuron degeneration in a mouse model of α-syn neurotoxicity ( Torrente et al., 2023 ). In the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloid accumulation, clenbuterol was reported to lessen plaques, increase neurogenesis and synapse formation, and improve memory deficits ( Chai et al., 2016 ; Chai et al., 2017 ). It prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and tau pathology after brain infusion of Aβ in mice ( Chai et al., 2022 ). Clenbuterol slowed disease progression in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Teng et al., 2006 ). In a model of inflammation-induced Parkinson’s disease, it prevented dopamine neuron loss and loss of motor function ( O’Neill et al., 2020 ). Anti-inflammatory effects of clenbuterol have been reported in mouse and rat brain, as well as a rat excitotoxicity model ( McNamee et al., 2010 ; Ryan et al., 2011 ; Gleeson et al., 2010 ). A controlled-release formulation was reported to deliver clenbuterol for two weeks after intramuscular injection ( Lin et al, 2023 ). It reduced inflammation and improved behavior in a rat model of aluminum-induced cognitive impairment. CuraSen has presented data at conferences that β2-receptor agonists increase regional blood flow in the brain, a marker of metabolic health. At the March 2021 AD/PD meeting, company scientists reported that salbutamol (albuterol) increased thalamic perfusion measured by arterial spin labeling-MRI in 12 healthy people ( press release ).

It belongs to the gliflozin class of glucose-lowering agents that includes empagliflozin . These drugs inhibit the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2), which is responsible for 90 percent of glucose reabsorption in the kidney. As a result, glucose is secreted via the urine. This lowers blood glucose, thus alleviating glucose toxicity, improving insulin sensitivity, and promoting weight loss. In clinical trials, dapagliflozin also reduced the chance of hospitalization for heart failure in people with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for developing dementia, and people with Alzheimer’s disease display signs of insulin resistance in the brain. These findings have spurred testing of multiple classes of diabetes drug for the treatment or prevention of AD (for example, see nasal insulin , pioglitazone , metformin , liraglutide and semaglutide ).

The therapeutic dose is 100 mg daily. Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. It is sold as a nutritional supplement, purportedly to treat cancer and other diseases, but with no peer-reviewed evidence to back such claims. Doses up to 1 gram daily appear safe. This drug combination targets and eliminates senescent cells that are linked to multiple age-related chronic diseases. Senescent cells have undergone irreversible cell-cycle arrest in response to damage or stress, but resist apoptotic cell death; they can persist for years. Some produce pro-inflammatory mediators, and studies implicate them in diabetes, osteoporosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and general age-related frailty, as well as in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's disease brain, and in other conditions (reviewed in Kirkland and Tchkonia, 2020 ). Dasatinib induces apoptosis in senescent cells by inhibiting the Src tyrosine kinase, while quercetin does so by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. The rationale for so-called “senolytic therapy” for AD arises from studies implicating senescent glia, neurons, and endothelial cells in neurodegeneration due to tau or amyloid pathology ( Sep 2018 news ; Bryant et al., 2020 ; Gonzales et al., 2021 ). In one preclinical study, treating rTg4510 human-mutant-tau-expressing mice with D+Q every two weeks for six months resulted in less tau tangle pathology, preservation of neurons and synapses, and better cerebral blood flow compared to untreated mice ( Musi et al., 2018 ). In the APPPS1 mouse model of AD, senescent oligodendrocytes were found surrounding amyloid plaques. D+Q eliminated the senescent cells, reduced amyloid load and inflammation, and improved memory behaviors (see Apr 2019 news on Zhang et al., 2019 ). The same study identified senescent oligodendrocytes in human postmortem AD brain tissue. In contrast, D+Q did not reduce senescent cell markers in brain, nor did it improve cognitive behaviors in P301S tau-expressing mice ( Riordan et al., 2023 ). D+Q treatment of healthy young female mice reportedly diminished metabolism and cognition; it had no effect on young males ( Fang et al., 2023 ). Quercetin has been reported to also have anti-amyloid and fibril-disaggregating activity ( Jiménez-Aliaga et al., 2011 ). D+Q is administered in an intermittent-dosing regimen, based on the idea that the combination quickly eliminates senescent cells, and it takes several weeks for the body's tissues to generate new ones. In people with diabetic kidney disease, three days treatment with D+Q reduced senescent cell numbers and inflammation in adipose tissue biopsies taken 11 days later ( Hickson et al., 2019 ; Hickson et al., 2020 ).","Overview Name: Dasatinib + Quercetin Therapy Type: Combination, Small Molecule (timeline) , Supplement, Dietary (timeline) Target Type: Tau (timeline) , Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1/2)",ongoing,1.0,False,,21 Sep 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/dasatinib-quercetin

Released by glial cells, ADNP contains within it a peptide of the eight amino acids Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln. This peptide has highly potent neuroprotective activity. Initial published data supporting the rationale for its therapeutic potential range from reports on in-vitro neuroprotection against Aβ, viruses, and oxidative stress to neuroprotection in rodent models of stroke and hypoxia (see Jul 2002 news story ). ADNP is involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and microtubule stabilization. It plays a role in brain development, and ADNP mutations cause a syndrome of intellectual deficiency and developmental delays with features of autism. Mutants are associated with ER stress that activates the unfolded protein response, defective neurodifferentiation, impaired cell survival, and tau pathology (e.g., Bieluszewska et al., 2025 ; Grigg et al., 2020 ). Somatic mutations of ADNP were found in AD brain, and mutation frequency correlated with the extent of tau pathology ( Ivashko-Pachima et al., 2021 ). In preclinical work, davunetide/NAP improved memory and cognition in mice. Genetic ADNP reduction impairs performance in the Morris water maze, and intranasal dosing with NAP was reported to reverse the effect. In a triple transgenic mouse model of AD, NAP reduced amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation and improved performance in the Morris water maze ( Vulih-Shultzman et al., 2007 ; May 2007 news story ; Matsuoka et al., 2008 ). Similar improvements were reported in Aβ42-treated rats ( Zhang et al., 2017 ). NAP was reported to rescue a neuronal dysfunction phenotype in a fly model of tauopathy ( Quraishe et al., 2013 ). In mice, ADNP truncation led to tauopathy, which was corrected by NAP treatment ( Karmon et al., 2022 ). NAP promoted tau binding to microtubules, and reduced tau phosphorylation in cells ( Ivashko-Pachima et al., 2017 ; Ivashko-Pachima and Gozes, 2018 ; Chen et al., 2025 ). ADNP’s actions on neurogenesis, neural plasticity, and gene expression were reported to be sex-specific (e.g., Shapira et al., 2024 ; reviewed in Gozes, 2024 ). Other preclinical studies have reported beneficial effects of NAP in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury ( Jouroukin et al., 2013 ; Fleming et al., 2011 ).

DBS-fornix places electrodes in the fiber tract that connects the hippocampus to other parts of the limbic system, and is intended to modulate or ease dysfunction of memory circuits in the brain. A large body of evidence links fornix pathology, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and the development of Alzheimer’s dementia (reviewed in Benear et al., 2020 ). The memory-enhancing effects of fornix stimulation were observed incidentally in a patient undergoing DBS to treat obesity at Toronto Western Hospital in Canada ( Hamani et al., 2008 ). Instead of affecting appetite, the stimulation induced a flashback to a decades-old memory during surgery, and improvement in verbal and spatial memory assessments afterwards. After this, the Toronto investigator founded Functional Neuromodulation to pursue DBS-fornix (DBS-f) as a potential treatment for AD (for rationale, see Mirzadeh et al., 2015 ). This study, and other single-case reports, have been criticized as potentially misleading ( Jun 2010 news ). Several preclinical studies documented improved memory after DBS-f stimulation in rats (e.g., Hescham et al., 2012 ; reviewed in Senova et al., 2020 ).

Pairs of electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain and connected to a pulse generator placed under the skin on the chest.,"Background Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an invasive treatment. Pairs of electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain and connected to a pulse generator placed under the skin on the chest. DBS-nbM delivers low-frequency stimulation to the nucleus basalis of Meynert in the basal forebrain. The nbM is a major source of acetylcholine in the brain, with projections to the hippocampus and cortex. Its degeneration in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Lewy body diseases results in loss of cholinergic transmission and subsequent cognitive decline. In Parkinson’s patients, acetylcholine deficits are also linked to delusions and visual hallucinations. Using DBS to activate these neurons and stimulate acetylcholine release thus targets the same pathway as cholinesterase inhibitors. In addition to enhanced acetylcholine release, potential mechanisms of DBS-nbM include increased cerebral blood flow, neurotrophic factor release, neuroplasticity, and hippocampal enlargement. DBS-nbM improved cognitive measures in rats with basal forebrain cholinergic neuron lesions, and promoted neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performance in rats with scopolamine-induced dementia ( Lee et al., 2016 ; Liu et al., 2022 ). Healthy adult rats, but not aged rats, increased secretion of nerve growth factor in the cortex in response to DBS-nbM ( Hotta et al., 2009 ). In the APP/PS1 model of AD, high-frequency, bilateral nbM stimulation improved animals’ performance in the Morris water maze ( Huang et al., 2019 ). In a transgenic rat model of AD, bilateral intermittent DBS-nbM led to supernormal performance on a spatial memory task ( Koulousakis et al., 2020 ). Monkeys exposed to intermittent stimulation improved performance in a working memory task, and DBS was as effective as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( Liu et al., 2017 ). In this study, continuous stimulation impaired performance (for review of primate studies, see Bava et al., 2023 ). Interest in DBS-nbM for Parkinson’s disease was spurred by a case report that stimulation of the nbM in a PD patient with dementia led to a marked improvement in several cognitive tests, which reversed to baseline when the electrodes were shut off (see Jun 2009 news on Freund et al., 2009 ). Another case report supported the feasibility of dual stimulation, e.g., using a single lead with multiple electrodes to simultaneously stimulate the nbM and the subthalamic nuclei (STN, Nombela et al., 2019 ). The latter is a standard clinical target for DBS to control motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Other clinical studies evaluating DBS for AD are targeting the fornix and the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, a modulator of frontal lobe networks ( Scharre et al., 2018 ).","Overview Name: Deep Brain Stimulation-nucleus basalis of Meynert Synonyms: DBS-nbM Therapy Type: Procedural Intervention Target Type: Cholinergic System (timeline) , Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2)",ongoing,2.0,False,,21 Sep 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/deep-brain-stimulation-nucleus-basalis-meynert

It is a second-line treatment for iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions in people with thalassemia who do not respond to or cannot take other chelators. It was approved in the European Union in 1999, and in the U.S. in 2011. Generic versions are available. The most common side effects include red-brown urine from iron secretion, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Deferiprone can cause low granulocyte or neutrophil counts. Perturbed iron homeostasis is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other diseases. People with AD and PD show elevated iron in specific brain regions (for review, see Belaidi and Bush, 2015 ). Excess brain iron has been reported to correlate with accelerated cognitive decline in people with AD, whether measured in postmortem tissue ( Ayton et al., 2019 ), by MRI ( Ayton et al., 2017 ), or by using CSF ferritin as a biomarker ( Ayton et al., 2015 ). Studies variously suggest excess iron may harm neurons by promoting Aβ production, Aβ and tau toxicity, oxidative cell death, and/or microglia-driven inflammation.

The iron chelator clioquinol and its derivative PBT2 both have been reported to lessen amyloid deposition and improve cognition in such models.

It is being developed for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) associated with Parkinson’s disease. Dyskinesias are uncontrollable, sometimes disabling, muscle contractions brought on by therapeutic doses of levodopa. Dipraglurant reduces the abnormal glutamate signaling that contributes to dyskinesia. The only drug approved to treat LID is amantadine, which also blocks glutamate signaling. In preclinical work, dipraglurant rendered LID less severe in a macaque model of PD, without reducing levodopa’s efficacy ( Bezard et al., 2014 ). Dipraglurant also reduced involuntary muscle contractions in a mouse model of dystonia, by restoring brain synaptic plasticity ( Sciamanna et al., 2014 ; Martella et al., 2021 ). The drug improved symptoms in rodent models mimicking non-motor symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive behaviors ( Epping-Jordan et al., 2023 ).

It started out as a backup to Denali’s lead LRRK2 inhibitor, DNL201 ; but it is now its lead candidate after development of DNL201 was stopped in 2020. LRRK2, also known as Dardarin, is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity. Kinase-activating mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most frequent cause of inherited PD (reviewed in Schneider and Alcalay, 2020 ). Other variants in the gene are associated with higher risk of sporadic PD, and there is some evidence for LRRK2 kinase activation in idiopathic PD ( Di Maio et al., 2018 ). Increased LRRK2 kinase activity impairs vesicle trafficking and lysosome function, and promotes neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to PD pathology (see review by Taylor and Alessi, 2020 ; Shutinoski et al., 2019 ; Sep 2018 news ). Several companies are pursing LRRK2 inhibitors for treating PD; Denali was the first to begin clinical testing. Recently, cryoEM structures of wild-type and PD-linked mutants of LRRK2, with and without investigational inhibitors or it endogenous activator Rab29, were solved, supporting structure-based design of compounds targeting its kinase domain ( Murillo et al., 2023 , Zhu et al., 2023 ). No preclinical data have been published on DNL151. However, reducing LRRK2 activity using other inhibitors or by genetic knockdown in rodent models of PD has been reported to reduce α-synuclein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuron loss ( Daher et al., 2014 ; Daher et al., 2015 , Ho et al., 2022 ; Ho et al., 2022 ). Inhibitors also promoted physiological tetramerization and synaptic localization of α-synuclein ( Fonseca-Ornales et al., 2022 ; Brzozowski et al., 2021 ). In animal and cell models of Aβ42 toxicity, inhibiting LRRK2 attenuated neuroinflammation ( Mutti et al., 2023 ; Filippini et al., 2023 ). Besides brain, LRRK2 is highly expressed in the lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Knockout or systemic inhibition of LRRK2 was found to change lung morphology in rats or macaque monkeys, possibly by affecting lysosomal function ( Fuji et al., 2015 ). This raised safety concerns of systemic LRRK2 inhibition. Recent data confirmed that three different inhibitors caused an accumulation of large vacuoles in lung cells of treated monkeys; this response did not compromise lung function after two weeks of treatment, and the changes reversed after the drugs were stopped ( Baptista et al., 2020 ). Other investigational LRRK2 inhibitors have been reported to cause lasting changes in lung tissue ( Miller et al., 2023 ). LRRK2 knockout in rats caused changes in kidney function and morphology, which could be mitigated by diet ( Ness et al., 2013 ; Gu et al., 2023 ). In people, mutations in one copy of the LRRK2 gene that lead to partial reductions in kinase activity do not impair lung, liver, or kidney, function, or appear to cause specific health problems ( Whiffin et al., 2020 ).

It was being developed to treat Parkinson’s disease. Also known as Dardarin, LRRK2 is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity. Kinase-activating mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most frequent cause of inherited PD (reviewed in Schneider and Alcalay, 2020 ). Other variants in the gene are associated with higher risk of sporadic PD, and there is some evidence for LRRK2 kinase activation in idiopathic PD ( Di Maio et al., 2018 ). Increased LRRK2 kinase activity impairs vesicle trafficking and lysosome function, and promotes neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to PD pathology (see review by Taylor and Alessi, 2020 ; Shutinoski et al., 2019; Sept 2018 news ). Several companies are pursing LRRK2 inhibitors for treating PD; Denali was the first to begin clinical testing.

It inhibits the cell's unfolded protein response in an attempt to restore protein synthesis.,"Background DNL343 is a brain-penetrant activator of the eukaryotic initiation factor EIF2b. It inhibits the cell's unfolded protein response in an attempt to restore protein synthesis. Normally, EIF2b, with its EIF2a subunit, functions to initiate mRNA translation. Under conditions of cellular stress, phosphorylation of the EIF2a subunit by the PERK kinase leads to inhibition of EIF2b, and pauses protein synthesis as part of the cell’s integrated stress response (ISR). Loss-of-function mutations in EIF2b that impair protein translation cause a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome affecting the brain and spinal cord, called vanishing white matter disease (see OMIM ). In some neurodegenerative diseases, maladaptive PERK activation and EIF2b inhibition occur as part of the cellular response to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (for example, Stutzbach et al., 2013 ). The resulting deficit in protein synthesis contributes to synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment. EIF2b inhibition is also linked to stress granule formation and pathogenic protein aggregation. Restoring EIF2b activity using PERK inhibitors or genetic approaches has been shown to protect against neurodegeneration in preclinical models of prion disease, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS (reviewed in Smith and Mallucci, 2016 ). A publication describes the discovery and optimization of DNL343 for clinical development ( Craig et al., 2024 ). In animal studies, DNL343 had a long half-life and high oral availability, and readily entered the CNS. Preclinical toxicology revealed no safety signs. In mice with a mutated, low-activity form of EIF2b, the compound normalized expression of genes related to the integrated stress response in brain. In these mice, DNL343 reduced ISR activation, improved movement, and prolonged survival; it also prevented neurodegeneration in a mouse model of acute optic nerve injury ( Yulyaningsih et al., 2024 ). The animal work identified potential biomarkers of DNL343 activity that were increased in the mouse models, and reduced after DNL343 treatment. Among them, growth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL), were confirmed to be increased in patients with vanishing white matter disease. While no other preclinical data are published on DNL343, there is a growing literature on the EIF2b activator, ISRIB, that formed the basis for research at Denali and at least one other company, Calico Life Sciences (see Wong et al., 2019 ). ISRIB counteracts the effects of EIF2a phosphorylation, increasing protein synthesis and preventing stress granule formation; it also improves learning and memory in mice ( Sidrauski et al., 2013 ; Sidrauski et al., 2015 ; Sidrauski et al., 2015 ). The ISRIB binding site on EIF2b has been resolved by X-ray crystallography ( Zyryanova et al., 2018 ; Tsai et al., 2018 ; and review by Marintchev and Ito, 2020 ). In preclinical work, ISRIB was neuroprotective in models of head trauma, Down's syndrome, and vanishing white matter disease ( Chou et al., 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ; Abbink et al., 2019 ). It also protected neurons from SOD-1 toxicity in a cellular model of ALS ( Bugallo et al., 2020 ). In prion-infected mice, ISRIB appeared safer than the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, which showed pancreatic toxicity ( Halliday et al., 2015 ). In Alzheimer’s models, ISRIB prevented Aβ-induced cell death ( Hosoi et al., 2016 ) but did not improve cognition in either the APPswe or hAPP-J20 models, and daily dosing led to significant mortality in the former ( Briggs et al., 2017 ; Johnson and Kang, 2016 ). More recent studies did report effects counteracting synaptic and memory loss in AD mouse models and in a rat model of Aβ42 injection ( Oliveira et al., 2021 ; Hu et al., 2022 ). ISRIB also prevented tau phosphorylation at residues 181 and 217 that occurred in response to synaptic long-term depression ( Zhang et al., 2022 ).","Overview Name: DNL343 Chemical Name: 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-N-(3-(5-((1s,3s)-3-(trifluoromethoxy)cyclobutyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)acetamide Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis U.S. FDA Status: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Discontinued) Company: Denali Therapeutics Inc.",discontinued,,False,,07 Mar 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/dnl343

To restore brain progranulin levels, DNL593 uses a ""brain shuttle"" technology, aka protein transfer vehicle (PTV), to move intravenously administered protein across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. Protein transfer vehicles were developed to deliver BACE-1 antibodies into the brain, but can be used to transport other payloads, as well (e.g., Kariolis et al., 2020 ). DNL593 consists of progranulin protein fused to an antibody fragment that binds to the transferrin receptor. Association with transferrin receptors on BBB endothelial cells facilitates the receptor-mediated transcytosis of progranulin protein into the brain. In preclinical studies, DNL593 enhanced brain uptake of peripherally administered progranulin by three- to 10-fold over a progranulin fusion protein that did not bind transferrin receptor.

Epidemiological research has linked high DHA consumption with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Morris et al., 2003 , Zhang et al., 2016 ).","Background Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is one of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the human brain. Epidemiological research has linked high DHA consumption with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Morris et al., 2003 , Zhang et al., 2016 ). People ingest DHA from foods such as fatty fish, walnuts, or flax seeds, or from dietary supplements. These are being marketed in different formulations of DHA, or DHA mixed with other omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In early epidemiology work, elevated blood DHA levels correlated with reduced dementia risk in some but not all studies ( Schaefer et al., 2006 ; Laurin et al., 2003 ). Newer studies support the link between DHA intake or blood levels and a reduced risk of cognitive decline or AD (e.g. Wei et al., 2023 ; He et al., 2023 ; Shang et al., 2018 ). In people with AD, higher serum DHA was associated with slower cognitive decline ( Chu et al., 2022 ). An analysis of ADNI data associated low omega-3 in red blood cells with greater Aβ accumulation and memory decline ( Rouch et al., 2022 ). Data from the large Framingham Heart study correlated higher DHA or EPA in red blood cells with larger hippocampal volume and better abstract reasoning at midlife, and up to half the risk of incident AD in older adults ( Satizabal et al., 2022 ; Sala-Vila et al., 2022 ). This and other studies (e.g., Sala-Vila et al., 2021 ; Coughlan et al., 2021 ) indicate that ApoE4 genotype affects the relationship of DHA status to cognition and neurodegeneration biomarkers (for review see Zhange et al., 2023 ). More recently, a cross-sectional analysis correlated higher blood omega-3 concentrations with better brain glucose uptake in participants at risk of AD ( Lazaro et al., 2024 ). In contrast, U.K. Biobank data indicate fish oil supplementation in older people reduced risk of all-cause dementia, but not specifically of AD ( Huang et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2022 ). In the same population, total omega-3 status, but not DHA alone, correlated with lowered risk of dementia ( Sala-Vila et al., 2023 ). A smaller study found no association of circulating DHA with incident dementia over 13 years ( de Oliveira Otto et al., 2023 ). Multiple autopsy studies have described deficits of DHA-containing phospholipids in brain tissue from people with Alzheimer's, which correlates with markers of the disease (reviewed in Heath and Wood, 2021 ). In samples from dementia with Lewy body cases, low levels of DHA-containing phospholipids were associated with lower soluble Aβ42, higher phosphorylated α-synuclein, and diminished synaptic proteins ( Chong et al., 2023 ). In animal studies, oral intake of DHA leads to a reduction of amyloid, tau, and neuritic pathology ( Lim et al., 2005 ; Green et al., 2007 ; Calon et al., 2004 ). This appears to stem from beneficial effects on amyloid processing, inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic function (for review see Mett 2021 ). In APP/PS mice, omega-3 supplementation reversed some effects of a high-fat diet on Aβ peptide expression, insulin resistance, and inflammation ( Ma et al., 2022 ). DHA reduced retinal amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice, when delivered as a lysophosphatidylcholine form uniquely bioavailable to retinal cells ( Sugasini et al., 2023 ). Nasal delivery of DHA reduced tau phosphorylation and improved cognitive function in J20 transgenic mice, or after brain injection of Aβ peptides in normal mice ( Zussy et al., 2022 ). DHA supplementation also reversed cognitive and olfactory deficits due to ApoE4 expression in transgenic mice ( González et al., 2023 ; Lessard-Beaudoin et al., 2021 ).","Overview Name: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) Synonyms: Omega-3 fatty acid Therapy Type: Supplement, Dietary (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 4) Company: Martek Biosciences Corporation, NeuroBioPharm, Inc.",ongoing,4.0,True,,25 Nov 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/docosahexaenoic-acid-dha

The effect size of donepezil's benefit is small, though one patient-level analysis has suggested greater benefit in early responders than in non-responders ( Levine et al., 2022 ). Donepezil does not modify the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Even so, this symptomatic treatment has become a mainstay of Alzheimer's therapy in North America. Donepezil is used off-label for other conditions including dementia with Lewy bodies, traumatic brain injury, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. Besides the standard 5- and 10-mg tablets of donepezil, a rapidly disintegrating tablet, as well as liquid, oral jelly, and transdermal formulations have been developed, but thus far approved only in select countries. In July 2010, the FDA approved a once-daily, sustained-release 23-mg tablet for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. This formulation sparked controversy. The advocacy group Public Citizen in 2011 unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA to withdraw it, charging that the formulation was more toxic than the 10-mg tablets without clearly showing greater benefit ( Public Citizens Petition ). In March 2022, a transdermal patch delivering 5 or 10 mg daily for one week was approved in the United States ( press release ). Generic versions of donepezil tablets are available in the United States and many European countries. Donepezil reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine after its release from the presynapse. Donepezil and other acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of the acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, enhancing cholinergic transmission. Donepezil delays the progressive worsening of cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. It has also been reported to mediate a reduction in delirium induced by hospital admission in critically ill patients with dementia ( Lieberman et al., 2023 ). Donepezil was first approved to be marketed in the United States in 1996, with registration following suit in Canada and the European Union in 1997 and in many other countries shortly thereafter. In 2006/2007, regulatory approval was granted in the United States and Canada, but not in Europe, for its use in the treatment of severe Alzheimer's. Eisai's applications in the United States and Europe for regulatory approval of donepezil for vascular dementia in 2002 and 2003 were rejected and development for this indication stopped, though the drug is being marketed for vascular dementia in India and several other countries. Donepezil was approved in Japan in 2014 for Lewy body dementia. Donepezil's most common side effects are gastrointestinal, i.e., diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; dizziness, sleeplessness/fatigue, and urinary incontinence also have been reported.

It is an agonist of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors found in the brain and in peripheral tissues. Taken in capsule or liquid form, dronabinol has the same central actions as THC. It was approved by the FDA in 1985 for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and in 1992 for the treatment of anorexia and weight loss in people with AIDS. The term dronabinol refers to generic versions of Abbvie's brand Marinol. In trials, the most frequent side effects were euphoria, dizziness, sleepiness, nausea and vomiting, abnormal thinking, paranoia, and abdominal pain. Risks of dronabinol in older people include delirium, sedation, seizures, blood pressure changes, and increased heart rate. It has a low potential for abuse or dependence. The dose for appetite stimulation is 5 to 10 mg per day, reached after gradual titration and taken as two divided doses. For nausea, the maximum dose is 15 mg, four to six times daily. Older people are started on lower doses to minimize CNS symptoms. The primary interest in repurposing dronabinol and other cannabinoids (see nabilone , cannabidiol ) for Alzheimer's disease currently focuses on the symptomatic treatment of agitation and aggression. Cannabinoids are mildly sedative and anxiolytic, and may act by reducing neuroinflammation, regulating neurotransmission, and improving sleep and circadian rhythms (reviewed in Outen et al., 2021 ). These compounds also increase appetite and decrease pain, which may benefit people with dementia. There is a large body of preclinical research on cannabinoids’ disease-modifying actions, in particular their effects on microglia. In short, multiple receptor agonists have been shown to protect against Aβ-induced neural toxicity in AD animal models, by inhibiting inflammation, excitotoxity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tau hyperphosphorylation, and facilitating Aβ removal (reviewed by Cristino et al., 2020 ).","Overview Name: Dronabinol Synonyms: THC , Marinol, Syndros, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-9-THC Chemical Name: (6aR,10aR)-6,6,9-Trimethyl-3-pentyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[c]chromen-1-ol Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other Neurotransmitters (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2) Company: AbbVie, Others Approved for: Anorexia and weight loss in people with AIDS; Second-line treatment of nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy",ongoing,2.0,False,,10 Mar 2022,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/dronabinol

For ALS, the drug is given in cycles of intravenous infusions daily for two weeks, followed by a two-week break. It can cause hives, swelling, and shortness of breath in some people, due to anaphylactic reactions to sulfite-containing infusion components. Otherwise, it is well tolerated. Common side effects are bruising, problems walking, and headaches.

The compound has been reported in various cell-based and preclinical models to protect neurons against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and memory deficits (e.g. Hirata et al., 2005 ; Nguyen et al., 2007 ; Kimura et al., 2009 ).

A non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, it is taken in pill form. It can cause serious side effects, including changes in mental health, liver toxicity, and severe skin rash and allergic reactions. Interest in repurposing this drug for Alzheimer’s disease stems from the discovery that doses 100 times lower than used for HIV promote cholesterol efflux from the brain. Excess brain cholesterol, and altered cholesterol metabolism, are both implicated in AD. Low-dose efavirenz lowers brain cholesterol by allosterically activating the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxlyase, also known as CYP46A1 ( Mast et al., 2014 ). CYP46A1-mediated modification is the major pathway for eliminating excess cholesterol from the brain. In preclinical work, efavirenz lessened memory loss in 5XFAD mice, and reduced brain amyloid when started early ( Petrov et al., 2019 ; Mast et al., 2017 ). Treatment was associated with changes in astrocyte and microglial activation, expression of synaptic proteins, and membrane properties ( Petrov et al., 2019 ; Petrov et al., 2020 ). Efavirenz affected multiple pathways, based on a proteomic and lipidomic comparison of treated and untreated mice ( Mast et al., 2024 ). This work was all done in one lab, but it is supported by previous studies on modulation of Aβ and tau pathology by CYP46A1 and cholesterol metabolism (e.g., see Djelti et al., 2015 ; Hudry et al., 2010 ; Burlot et al., 2015 ). In one study, the benefits of increased CYP46A1 activity on synaptic health and cognition were seen in female, but not male, mice ( Jan 2024 news on Latorre-Leal et al. 2024 ). Efavirenz was independently identified in an unbiased screen for phospho-tau-lowering drugs using neurons derived from Alzheimer’s patient stem cells ( Feb 2019 news on van der Kant et al., 2019 ). In this system, reduction of the abundance of cholesterol esters promoted phospho-tau degradation by the proteasome. The drug also reduced Aβ42 production, but by a different mechanism involving cholesterol binding to the amyloid precursor protein. In another study, efavirenz promoted uptake of tau seeds into cells, by changing the cholesterol makeup of cell membranes ( May 2022 news on Tuck et al., 2022 ). Efavirenz was reported to diminish the frequency of retinal vascular lesions in AD mice, suggesting a potential use in people with macular degeneration ( El-Darzi et al., 2022 ).

Empagliflozin belongs to the gliflozin class of glucose-lowering agents that includes dapagliflozin . These drugs inhibit the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2), which is responsible for 90 percent of glucose reabsorption into the kidney. As a result, excess glucose is secreted via the urine, helping reduce blood glucose, alleviate glucose toxicity, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote weight loss. Empagliflozin also lowers the risk of death from heart attack and stroke in people with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for developing dementia, and people with Alzheimer’s disease display signs of insulin resistance in the brain. These findings have spurred evaluation of multiple classes of diabetes drug for the treatment or prevention of AD (for example, see nasal insulin , pioglitazone , metformin , liraglutide , semaglutide ). In a mixed mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and Type 2 diabetes, treatment with empagliflozin for 22 weeks helped maintain insulin levels, reduced neuronal loss, microgliosis, amyloid load, and brain hemorrhage. The mice were reported to show improvement in cognitive deficits ( Hierro-Bujalance et al., 2020 ). Similar results were reported in a different Type 2 diabetes/AD model ( Sim et al., 2023 ). In a large Danish epidemiological cohort, use of SGLT2 inhibitors, among other diabetes drugs, reduced the risk of dementia in people with Type 2 diabetes ( Wium-Andersen et al., 2019 ). More recent cohort studies concur, finding 11 to 29 percent lower dementia risk in people who take empagliflozin, compared to other glucose-lowering medications ( Siao et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2023 ; Chen et al., 2024 ). In a Korean cohort study, use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a 39 percent reduction in the risk for Alzheimer’s disease compared to other diabetes drugs ( Shin et al., 2024 ). One study reported a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease as well ( Mui et al., 2021 ). Besides lowering glucose, SGLT2 inhibitors increase production of ketone bodies. Formed by the breakdown of fatty acids, ketone bodies provide an alternative to glucose as a fuel source in the brain. Because brain glucose metabolism is impaired in AD, there has been interest in ketogenic food products or diets as potential treatments (e.g., tricaprilin ; Taylor et al., 2018 ). Empagliflozin may offer an additional way to induce moderate chronic ketosis. An excess of ketone bodies can cause a life-threating acidification of the blood. Occurrence of this ketoacidosis was negligible in empagliflozin trials, but has since been reported in some people taking the drug ( Yamamoto et al., 2019 ; McGill and Subramian, 2019 ; Kaku et al., 2020 ).","Overview Name: Empagliflozin Synonyms: Jardiance, BI-10773 Chemical Name: (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-[4-Chloro-3-[[4-[(3S)-oxolan-3-yl]oxyphenyl]methyl]phenyl]-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-3,4,5-triol Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1) Company: Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly & Co.

The compound is being developed for treatment of the rapidly progressing synucleinopathy multiple-system atrophy (MSA) and for Parkinson's disease (PD). It could potentially be applied to other synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This diphenyl pyrazole compound has been shown to suppress oligomer formation in vitro and in vivo. It inhibited pathogenic protein accumulation and neurodegeneration, and improved survival in mouse models of α-synuclein and prion disease ( Apr 2011 conference news ; Wagner et al., 2013 ; Vallabh et al., 2023 ). Structural studies revealed that anle138b binding to α-synuclein fibrils involves stable polar interactions inside the tubular fibril cavity, and placed the small molecule's central pyrazole moiety near α-synuclein's protein backbone ( Antonschmidt et al., 2022 ; Dervişoğlu et al., 2023 ). In α-synuclein transgenic mouse models of PD, anle138b administration reduced protein deposition in brain and improved dopamine neuron function and movement, even when treatment began after symptoms developed ( Wegrzynowicz et al., 2019 ; Mar 2015 conference news ; Levin et al., 2014 ). In a mouse model of MSA created by overexpressing human α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes, anle138b reduced α-synuclein oligomers, preserved dopaminergic neurons, and improved walking compared with nontreated controls ( Heras-Garvin et al., 2019 ). In a model mimicking more severe MSA, anle138b slightly improved motor skills, but did not significantly change neurodegeneration or α-synuclein accumulation in glia in mice expressing α-synuclein and exposed to a mitochondrial toxin ( Fellner et al., 2016 ). Anle138b was also effective in mouse models of tau pathology, where treatment of young mice decreased neuron loss, increased survival, and improved cognition ( Aug 2014 conference news ; Wagner et al., 2015 ). Even in older tau mice with established pathology, the compound was able to lessen tau deposition and reverse metabolic decline ( Brendel et al., 2019 ). It inhibited tau aggregation in cell culture models, as well ( Dominguez-Meijide et al., 2020 ). Bioinformatics analyses proposed testable mechanisms of action for anle138b ( Kondratyev et al., 2022 ; Hosseini-Gerami et al., 2023 ). In the APP/PS1Δ9 mouse model of Aβ pathology, anle138b restored hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory ( Martinez Hernandez et al., 2018 ). A study comparing anle138b to the investigational α-synuclein immunotherapy Affitope PD03 reported that both improved PD-related outcomes such as α-syn oligomer levels, microglial activation, neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, and gait ( Lemos et al., 2020 ). Anle138b did not improve survival in knock-in mice expressing mutated proteins to model inherited prion disease ( Walsh et al., 2024 ). A PET tracer based on anle138b is in development ( Apr 2025 conference news ; Kuebler et al., 2020 ; Orlovskaya et al., 2023 ).","Overview Name: Emrusolmin Synonyms: Anle138b, TEV-56286 Chemical Name: 3-(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl)-5-(3-bromophenyl)-1H-pyrazole Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Tau (timeline) , alpha-synuclein, Other (timeline) Condition(s): Parkinson's Disease, Multiple System Atrophy U.S. FDA Status: Parkinson's Disease (Phase 1/2), Multiple System Atrophy (Phase 2) Company: MODAG GmbH, Teva",ongoing,2.0,False,,02 Oct 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/emrusolmin

It is well-tolerated, with mild to moderate diarrhea, headache, nausea, and rash being the most common side effects. Interest in repurposing reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) to treat Alzheimer’s disease arose from studies implicating DNA retrotransposon activity in aging and neurodegeneration. Increasing retrotransposon activity with age leads to the accumulation of nucleic acids in the cytosol of cells. There, they activate the immune system and promote inflammation, a causative factor in age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration. Nucleoside RTIs have been shown to reduce inflammation in animal models and in human clinical trials (e.g., De Cecco et al. 2019 ; Rice et al., 2018 ). One study reported intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity of nucleoside RTIs, independent of reverse transcriptase ( Fowler et al., 2014 ).

HGF is a multifunctional peptide with neurotrophic and angiogenic activity. The goal of this treatment is to prevent or reverse motor neuron loss in ALS by boosting muscle HGF concentration. Extensive research has shown that HGF acts through its tyrosine kinase receptor c-met to promote neuron survival and axonal outgrowth from sensory and motor neurons (e.g., see Ebens et al., 1996 ; Wong et al.,1997 ; Ko et al., 2018 ). In ALS rodent models, HGF delivered to the central nervous system lessened motor neuron degeneration and prolonged life span ( Sun et al., 2002 ; Ishigaki et al., 2007 ). These and other studies suggest HGF acts through multiple mechanisms including neurotrophic support for motor neurons, suppression of microgliosis, dampening of excitotoxic injury, facilitation of muscle reinnervation, and inhibition of apoptotic cell death. Engensis delivers HGF to muscle, not the central nervous system. Injection of the plasmid into the hind limb muscles of rabbits or mice caused detectable HGF expression for about two weeks, with peak protein production after seven days ( Pyun et al., 2010 ). No preclinical data on this DNA construct in ALS models are published. However, an adenovirus vector version with the same HGF coding sequence was tested in the SOD1-G93A genetic model of ALS. Intermuscular injection of the viral vector led to prolonged protein expression, increased muscle mass, alleviation of disease symptoms, and longer survival ( Lee et al., 2019 ).

EGCG has been reported to affect multiple biological pathways, such as gene expression, growth-factor-mediated signaling, mitogen-activated-protein kinase-dependent pathways, antioxidant pathways, and ubiquitin/proteasome degradation. Specifically in neurodegeneration research, EGCG has been proposed to inhibit the formation of toxic oligomers by steering misfolded Aβ, α-synuclein, and mutant huntingtin away from folding pathways that lead to amyloidogenic β-sheet structures, either by binding the protein directly or possibly by acting on a protein chaperone ( May 2008 news ).

Etanercept is a fusion protein consisting of two copies of the TNF-α receptor and the Fc end of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. Also called a decoy receptor, etanercept binds both the soluble and the membrane-bound forms of TNF-α, counteracting its signaling.

Its side effects include, among others, increased risk for serious infections including tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, and bacterial infections such as listeria (see Enbrel.com ). The rationale of evaluating peripheral administration of etanercept as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease derives from studies suggesting that low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation releases TNF-α, which reportedly can communicate from the periphery to the brain to induce a central immune response involving adverse microglial activation.

The rationale behind this approach is that γ-secretase modulators affect the enzyme complex differently than inhibitors: They shift its processive cleavage mechanism away from generating Aβ42 and other long forms of this peptide and toward generation of Aβ38 and other short forms of Aβ. Gamma-secretase modulators are designed to selectively reduce the amount of Aβ42 while letting cleavage of the Notch substrate proceed unimpeded. Aβ42 is the most aggregation-prone form of the peptide and lies upstream of the amyloid cascade. Inhibition of Notch cleavage is thought to have been largely responsible for the toxic side effects on the skin, immune, and gastrointestinal systems that occurred with γ-secretase inhibitors. In addition, γ-secretase inhibition does not affect the total amount of Aβ in the brain. EVP-0962 is an NSAID derivative without activity on the classic NSAID targets Cox 1 or 2.

In animal models of Parkinson’s disease, exenatide dampens inflammation and protects dopaminergic neurons, which were reported to express GLP-1 receptor ( Perry et al., 2002 ; Bertilsson et al., 2008 ; Cao et al., 2016 ; Jan 2009 news ). It also had beneficial effects in a mouse model of the rapidly progressing α-synucleinopathy multiple systems atrophy ( Bassil et al., 2017 ). Potential mechanisms of neuroprotection by GLP-1 mimetics are reviewed in Reich and Hö lscher, 2022 . In mouse models of AD, exendin-4 was reported to lower amyloid plaque load and protect against Aβ oligomers ( Li et al., 2010 ; Gengler et al., 2012 ; Bomfim et al., 2012 ). The related GLP-1 analog liraglutide was reported to have similar effects ( Dec 2010 news ). Exenatide also enhanced cognition in insulin-resistant rats ( Gad et al., 2016 ), and improved insulin receptor signaling and learning in Tg2576 mice ( Robinson et al., 2019 ).","Overview Name: Exenatide Synonyms: Exendin-4, Byetta, Bydureon Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Inactive), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 3) Company: AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly & Co.

According to information from its maker, AZP2006 binds to prosaposin, a cofactor for progranulin processing. Prosaposin and progranulin are lysosomal proteins that are genetically implicated in Parkinson’s risk (e.g., Valdez et al., 2020 ; Oji et al., 2020 ). Prosaposin regulates progranulin, and increased levels of both have been associated with AD neuropathology ( Nicholson et al., 2016 ; Mendsaikhan et al., 2019 ). Knockdown of prosaposin sensitizes neurons to oxidative stress, leading to ferroptosis ( Tian et al., 2021 ). AZP2006 stabilizes the prosaposin-progranulin complex. The drug-development rationale is that this stabilization prevents progranulin cleavage and increases progranulin secretion. Previously, an effect blocking tau phosphorylation had been claimed ( Medina, 2018 ; Jadhav et al., 2019 ). The drug is being developed for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, a rapidly progressing tauopathy that strikes in mid-life. At the 2020 AAT-AD/PD Focus meeting, the company presented results from cell and animal models. In primary rat neuron/microglia co-cultures exposed to Aβ42, the compound reportedly promoted neuron survival and prevented neurite loss. It increased progranulin secretion, inhibited microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine production, and decreased tau phosphorylation. In a naturally occurring mouse model of accelerated aging, called SamP8 , AZP2006 reportedly prevented or reversed cognitive deficits, while decreasing phosphorylated tau, Aβ, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. In tau-overexpressing mice, AZP2006 was reported to decrease tau phosphorylation. A subsequent peer-reviewed publication included these results, and also reported reductions in phosphotau181 and markers of inflammation, along with improved learning and memory behaviors, in mice injected with Aβ ( Callizot et al., 2021 ). At the 2023 AD/PD conference, the company presented preclinical data in a Parkinson’s disease cell model.

As a selective Aβ42-lowering agent (aka SALA), Flurizan™ would have been the first in its class to treat Alzheimer's disease. The rationale for testing Flurizan™ in Alzheimer's is that it can modulate γ-secretase, the enzyme complex that cleaves the Aβ peptide off its precursor protein, to selectively reduce generation of long, aggregation-prone forms of Aβ without affecting γ-secretase cleavage of other substrates, such as Notch. Epidemiological research has shown that long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced risk for development of Alzheimer disease. In contrast to S-fluriprofen, the R-enantiomer is inactive toward the cyclooxygenase enzyme, and hence causes fewer gastrointestinal side effects. In cell-based and animal studies, Flurizan™ has been shown to lower Aβ42, probably through a direct effect on y-secretase (see Weggen et al., 2001 ; Weggen et al., 2003 ). The presenilin component of the y-secretase intramembrane complex is thought to be the target of Flurizan™'s activity (see Eriksen et al., 2003 ; Beher et al., 2004 ).

The openings reseal within 24 hours.,"Background Focused ultrasound with microbubbles is a noninvasive procedure that transiently opens the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using low-intensity sound waves. The openings reseal within 24 hours. Using MRI to guide the ultrasound enables targeted opening of precise brain regions to facilitate drug delivery. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease, opening the BBB appears to promote amyloid removal. More than 20 years ago, researchers discovered that low-energy ultrasound waves paired with intravenous microbubbles routinely used as contrast agents temporarily loosened the BBB in rabbits ( Hynynen et al., 2001 ). The procedure has since been widely explored as a way to enable drug delivery to the brain. In mice, FUS-BBB was shown to elicit transient opening of the hippocampal blood-brain barrier, allowing entry of antibodies and larger molecules that normally would be excluded ( Choi et al., 2007 ; Choi et al., 2010 ). Optimized parameters for sonication energy, time, and microbubble dose were studied in mice and rats, to maximize safety while minimizing tissue damage and hemorrhaging ( Baseri et al., 2010 ; Choi et al., 2011 ; O’Reilly and Hynynen, 2012 ; Hsu et al., 2022 ). This led to studies in nonhuman primates ( McDannold et al., 2012 ), and in pigs with human skull implants ( Huang et al., 2017 ). In both, properly calibrated ultrasound/microbubble combinations appeared to cause no apparent tissue damage or long-term neurological effects. Work to optimize FUS-BBB protocols in humans continues ( Meng et al., 2021 ). The majority of human clinical studies involve delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to treat brain tumors. A large body of preclinical work underpins the use of this intervention to treat neurodegenerative disease. In Alzheimer's mouse models, targeted ultrasound reversibly opened the hippocampal BBB similarly to normal mice ( Choi et al., 2008 ; Raymond et al., 2008 ). BBB opening by itself, in the absence of adjunct drugs, was subsequently shown to activate microglia, stimulate neurogenesis, clear Aβ in targeted regions, improve synaptic long-term potentiation, and restore memory ( Jordão et al., 2013 ; Burgess et al., 2014 ; Scarcelli et al., 2014 ; Kong et al., 2023 ). In the rTg4510 amyloidosis mice, focused ultrasound reduced the levels of phosphorylated tau, when done before the onset of tau pathology ( Karakatsani et al., 2019 ). A modified technique that uses scanning ultrasound to produce widespread BBB opening was found to activate microglia, reduce cortical plaques and improve cognition in APP23 mice ( Mar 2015 news on Leinenga and Götz, 2015 , Leinenga and Götz, 2018 ). Aging and amyloid pathology enhanced BBB opening, and delayed closing, in mice ( Noel et al., 2023 ). The procedure is claimed to enhance glymphatic clearance of proteins from the mouse brain ( Ye et al., 2023 ). In a safety study using aged dogs with naturally occurring amyloid, four weekly treatments produced no changes on MRI, histology or neurologic exams. One adverse event of vomiting and bloody urine was possibly related to anesthesia or contrast agent injections ( O’Reilly et al., 2017 ). Animal studies in tauopathy models gave inconsistent results. In K391I mutant tau transgenic mice, repeat ultrasound was reported to reduce tau pathology and improve motor and cognitive behaviors ( Pandit et al., 2019 ). A different group reported no effect of ultrasound treatment on tau pathology in P301S tau mice ( Geraudie et al., 2023 ). In preclinical drug delivery studies, FUS-BBB was shown to increase brain concentrations and efficacy of amyloid and tau antibodies, neurotrophic factors, IvIG, a GSK-3 inhibitor, and viral vectors, in mouse models of AD and PD ( Jordao et al., 2010 ; Samiotaki et al., 2015 ; Nisbet et al., 2017 ; Janowicz et al., 2019 ; Karakatsani et al., 2019 ; Hsu et al., 2018 ; Ji et al., 2019 ; Dubey et al., 2020 ; Xhima et al., 2021 ; Antoniou et al., 2023 ). One paper reported FUS-enabled transplantation of neural stem cells in rats ( Burgess et al., 2011 ). FUS-BBB paired with an antibody to pyroglutamated Aβ resulted in fivefold higher brain antibody levels, greater plaque removal, synapse sparing, and improved cognitive function compared to antibody alone, in part due to enhanced recruitment of peripheral monocytes to plaques ( Sun et al., 2021 ; Bathini et al., 2022 ). In another study, ultrasound or an aducanumab analog reduced hippocampal plaque in APP23 mice, and the combination improved spatial memory ( Leinenga et al., 2021 ). Ultrasound reportedly enhanced brain levels of a new tau monoclonal antibody, but not its efficacy ( Bajracharya et al., 2022 ). FUS-BBB boosted delivery of GDNF gene therapy in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease and of edaravone in a model of ALS ( Lin et al., 2019 ; Shen et al., 2023 ). FUS-BBB caused no detectable adverse brain effects in mice up to six months after treatment ( Blackmore et al., 2018 ). Several studies have examined the response to FUS-BBB at the tissue and cell level. Transcriptional analysis, including single-cell sequencing of brain tissue after the procedure, showed upregulated phagosome pathway genes, microglial proliferation, more of the disease-associated microglia phenotype, and recruitment of central nervous system macrophages in targeted areas ( Kline-Schoder et al., 2023 ; Leinenga et al., 2023 ; Mathew et al., 2021 ). FUS-BBB enhanced aducanumab delivery, but did not change the endothelial cell transcriptome, endothelial or astrocyte viability, or inflammatory responses in an in-vitro BBB model generated from AD patient-derived cells ( Wasielewska et al., 2022 ). Most clinical studies to date use InSightec’s ExAblate® Neuro device. This helmet-mounted array of 1,200 probes is used with a stereotactic frame to deliver focused, low-intensity sound waves to defined brain regions while the patient is undergoing MRI. The device is approved in the U.S. and other countries for high-intensity surgical ablation of tissue, including to treat essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease. Temporarily opening the BBB requires 100-fold lower energy than tissue ablation. Other devices, including a frameless version, and an implantable sonicator, are in development (e.g. Epelbaum et al., 2022 ).","Overview Name: Focused Ultrasound – Blood-Brain Barrier Synonyms: FUS-BBB, MRgFUS, MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound, FUS+MB Therapy Type: Procedural Intervention Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) , Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Phase 1), Mild Cognitive Impairment (Phase 1), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 1)",ongoing,1.0,False,,22 Sep 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/focused-ultrasound-blood-brain-barrier

It modulates the immune system to promote immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory responses, in part by stimulating the production of regulatory T cells. This antibody, originally from Novimmune, was acquired by Tiziana. It is administered as an intranasal spray. Immune control by regulatory T cells (Tregs) appears to be compromised in people with AD ( Faridar et al., 2020 ). In animal studies, Tregs that were transferred into AD mice entered the brain and stopped Aβ plaque growth ( Faridar et al., 2022 ). Multiple labs have reported beneficial effects of Treg expansion on plaque load and memory deficits in mouse models of AD ( Dansokho et al., 2016 ; Alves et al., 2017 ; Yuan et al., 2023 ). The rationale for foralumab is similar to that of low-dose interleukin-2 , another immune modulatory therapy being tested in AD. In preclinical work with the 3XTg mouse model of AD, nasal administration of 1 microgram foralumab three times weekly for five months improved spatial learning and long-term memory, but caused no change in brain Aβ accumulation ( Lopes et al., 2023 ). Treatment increased the frequency of Tregs in the periphery, and promoted infiltration of T cells into the brain, where they associated with microglia. Microglial gene expression changed in favor of a homeostatic phenotype, rather than inflammatory or neurodegenerative profiles. Previously, nasal foralumab had been shown to increase Tregs, and ameliorate autoimmune symptoms in a model of Lupus in mice ( Wu eat al., 2008 ). In a multiple sclerosis mouse model, nasal antibody induced regulatory T cells that dampened brain microglia inflammation ( Mayo et al., 2016 ).

NDX-1017 is being developed as a subcutaneous once-daily injection. Hippocampal expression of MET receptors is diminished in Alzheimer’s disease ( Hamasaki et al., 2014 ). Conversely, expression of HGF by gene transfer improved Aβ-induced cognitive deficits in mice, and prevented motor symptoms and neuron loss in a rat model of parkinsonism ( Takeuchi et al., 2008 ; Koike et al., 2006 ). Direct, intrathecal administration of hepatocyte growth factor itself has been studied in a rat model of ALS and a marmoset model of traumatic brain injury, and is being investigated clinically for ALS in Japan ( Aoki et al., 2019 ). Fosgonimeton is a prodrug formulation of a small molecule originally identified in a screen for positive modulators of HGF/MET signaling ( Johnston et al., 2023 ). The small molecule, fosgonimeton-active metabolite (fosgo-AM), was reported to be neurotrophic and neuroprotective in primary rat neurons, and to reverse scopolamine-induced learning deficits in rats. To improve its pharmacokinetics, the company developed the prodrug formulation, which generated higher blood and brain levels of fosgo-AM than were possible with direct delivery of the metabolite. In a mouse model of cognitive impairment due to acute inflammation, fosgonimeton partly reversed cognitive deficits. It was also reported to prevent Aβ42 toxicity and protect dopamine neurons against 6-OHDA (2023 AD/PD conference poster , Reda et al., 2024 ). This drug may be related to N-hexanoic-Tyr-Ile-(6) aminohexanoic amide, aka Dihexa , U.S. Patent 8598118B2 .

In some neurodegenerative diseases, accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum shuts down protein production by inhibiting EIF2b as part of the so-called unfolded protein response, or integrated stress response (for example, see Stutzbach et al., 2013 ). The resulting deficit in global protein synthesis contributes to synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment. Restoring EIF2b activity has been shown to protect against neurodegeneration in preclinical models of prion disease, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS (reviewed in Smith and Mallucci, 2016 ). Calico licensed ABBV-CLS-7262 from Peter Walter's laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco. This group has published multiple papers on the integrated stress response inhibitor ISRIB, an activator of EIF2b that improves learning and memory in mice ( Sidrauski et al., 2013 ; Sidrauski et al., 2015 ; Sidrauski et al., 2015 ). In preclinical work, ISRIB was neuroprotective in models of head trauma, Down's syndrome, and vanishing white-matter disease ( Chou et al., 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ; Abbink et al., 2019 ). It also protected neurons from SOD-1 toxicity in a cellular model of ALS ( Bugallo et al., 2020 ). In Alzheimer’s models, ISRIB generated mixed results. It prevented Aβ-induced cell death ( Hosoi et al., 2016 ) but did not improve cognition in either the APPswe or hAPP-J20 models of AD, and daily dosing led to significant mortality in the former ( Briggs et al., 2017 ; Johnson and Kang, 2016 ). Other researchers reported that ISRIB prevented synaptic loss and memory deficits in an Aβ toxicity model, and restored synaptic function and memory in older APP/PS1 mice ( Oliveira et al., 2021 ). ISRIB was reported to normalize protein synthesis in the hippocampus and abrogate learning and memory deficits due to Aβ42 oligomer toxicity in rats ( Hu et al., 2022 ). It also prevented Tau phosphorylation at residues 181 and 217 that occurred in response to synaptic long-term depression ( Zhang et al., 2022 ).

HDACs are key enzymes in the epigenetic regulation of gene function.,"Background FRM-0334 is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs are key enzymes in the epigenetic regulation of gene function. By removing acetyl groups from histone proteins in chromatin, HDACs compress the chromatin and in this way repress gene expression. The rationale behind HDAC inhibition is based on evidence that decreased transcription of certain genes represents an underlying pathophysiological mechanism in several neurological disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In particular, HDAC inhibition appears to increase expression of progranulin ( Cenik et al., 2011 ). Haploinsufficiency of the progranulin gene is a genetic cause of familial frontotemporal dementia, and levels of progranulin protein are reduced in the blood of patients with several neurodegenerative diseases. Progranulin is a secreted growth factor, and increasing its expression via HDAC inhibition is thought to be neuroprotective. At the 2008 Society for Neuroscience conference, EVP-0334 was reported to selectively inhibit a subset of class I and II human HDACs with nanomolar IC50 values and good brain penetrance. In mice, oral administration was reported not only to increase acetylation of histones 2A, 3, and 4 in brain with a minimal effective dose of 10 mg/kg, but also to improve cognitive performance in novel object recognition and the Morris water maze at that same dose. This presentation also noted the safety of this compound when given for two weeks at 10 times the effective dose ( Patzke et al., SfN presentation abstract, 2008 ; Leventhal et al., SfN presentation abstract, 2008 ; see Dec 2008 conference news ). At the 2009 Society for Neuroscience conference, EnVivo Pharmaceuticals scientists presented data in rats. In this model, too, the compound was reported to penetrate into the brain, increase acetylation of several histones there, and at the same doses improve memory as measured by performance in two different paradigms ( Patzke et al., SfN presentation abstract, 2009 ). In 2014, EnVivo changed its name to Forum Pharmaceuticals ( Fierce Biotech news ).",Overview Name: FRM-0334 Synonyms: EVP-0334 Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Frontotemporal Dementia U.S. FDA Status: Frontotemporal Dementia (Discontinued) Company: FORUM Pharmaceuticals Inc.,discontinued,2.0,False,1.0,06 Oct 2021,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/frm-0334

Galantamine crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been used in humans for decades in anaesthesia and the treatment of neuropathic pain. Galantamine enhances cholinergic function in two ways: It is a weak acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric potentiator of both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors . Synthetic galantamine was first registered for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in Sweden in the year 2000; it was subsequently approved for this indication in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries around the world. Galantamine is available as a tablet, as solution, and, since 2005, as a once-daily extended-release capsule. Also in 2005, the trade name the name Reminyl ® was replaced with Razadyne TM to avoid confusion and prescribing errors arising from the similarity of the name Reminyl ® to the diabetes drug Amaryl ® (glimepiride). Since then, several generic equivalents have been approved by the FDA. In keeping with the other cholinesterase inhibitors approved to treat Alzheimer's—donepezil and rivastigmine—the most common side effects of galantamine are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Dizziness, insomnia or nightmares, agitation, mild arryhthmia, and other effects have also been reported. Adverse effects tend to be milder when the dose is titrated up to the final therapeutic dose slowly, over the course of two months.

It encompasses both N-terminal and central amino acids of Aβ. The therapeutic rationale for this antibody is that it acts centrally to disassemble and degrade amyloid plaques by recruiting microglia and activating phagocytosis. Gantenerumab preferentially interacts with aggregated brain Aβ, both parenchymal and vascular. It binds to cerebral amyloid angiopathy fibrils more avidly than some other Aβ antibodies ( Soderberg et al., 2024 ). The antibody elicits phagocytosis of human Aβ deposits in AD brain slices co-cultured with human macrophages. It also neutralizes oligomeric Aβ42-mediated inhibitory effects on long-term potentiation in rat brains. In APP/PS-1 transgenic mice, gantenerumab binds to cerebral Aβ, reduces small plaques by recruiting microglia, and prevents new plaque formation. Gantenerumab does not alter plasma Aβ ( Bohrmann et al., 2012 ). It has been studied as a potential combination therapy with the Roche BACE inhibitor RG7129 in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis ( Apr 2013 conference news ).","Overview Name: Gantenerumab Synonyms: RO4909832, RG1450, R1450 Therapy Type: Immunotherapy (passive) (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hoffmann-La Roche",discontinued,23.0,False,9.0,23 Sep 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/gantenerumab

Mediators of microglial responses in neurodegenerative diseases with an inflammatory component have attracted renewed interest in drug development research, years after several NSAIDs failed clinical trials. GC021109 reportedly is a prodrug for an agonist of microglial P2Y6 receptor. This is a metabotropic G-protein coupled receptor, whose natural ligand is adenosine diphosphate, a metabolite of ATP. Astrocytes release the ""gliotransmitter"" ATP in response to neuronal injury, the presence of cellular debris, and also the presence of Aβ plaques. P2Y6 signaling is thought to be involved in shifting the phenotype of microglia, which tend to surround amyloid plaques, from patrolling to phagocytic ( Dong et al., 2010 ). Aβ42 increased ATP release in cultured astrocytes, and ATP was neuroprotective in slice culture ( Mar 2012 news ). P2Y6 and its family of purinergic receptors have been most studied in neuropathic pain ( Inoue et al., 2009 ; Bernier et al., 2013 ; Inoue and Tsuda, 2012 ). GC021109 has been reported in the biotech press to stimulate both microglial phagocytosis and inhibit microglial release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12; however, this information is not published in the peer-reviewed literature ( Fidler 2014, Xconomy ).

These drugs activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), nuclear receptors involved in lipid metabolism. Fibrates reduce triglyceride levels. They are widely prescribed to control cholesterol and for related indications. Gemfibrozil came into use in the 1980s and is available as a generic. Some studies have linked the use of fibrates to reduced AD risk ( Defouil et al., 2005 ). More recently, gemfibrozil in particular has been considered to increase expression of microRNA 107 (NIH GrantOme ). Expression of miR107 has been reported to be reduced in Alzheimer's, which may contribute to the upregulation of BACE levels in this disease ( Feb 2008 news ; Nelson and Wang, 2010 ; Hebert et al., 2013 ). MiR107 has also been reported to be expressed in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, and proposed as a biomarker for mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease ( Wang et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2016 ). Panels for measuring CSF microRNA in neurodegeneration research are being developed ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Gemfibrozil-mediated activation of PPARα has also been reported to stimulate non-amyloidogenic APP processing by ADAM10, thus reducing Aβ production ( Corbett et al., 2015 ). Two preclinical studies reported that treating AD mouse models with gemfibrozil decreased amyloid plaque accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus, and improved learning and memory in a PPARα-dependent pathway ( Chandra and Pahan, 2019 ; Luo et al., 2019 ).

Mutations in the GBA1 gene encoding GCase are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease. Reduced GCase activity impairs lysosomal function and leads to accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein. GCase activity is also lower in sporadic Parkinson’s cases, suggesting that restoring GCase activity could be a viable strategy for the treatment of both genetic and non-genetic forms of the disease. As an allosteric modulator, GT-02287 binds at a location removed from the active site to enhance protein stability and enzymatic activity. It was discovered using computational methods to design drug candidates based on the atomic structure of human GCase. GT-02287 was shown to enhance GCase activity in cells from patients with Gaucher disease or GBA1 Parkinson’s ( Montpeyo et al., 2024 ). In cell models, GT-02287 enhanced lysosomal activity and reduced cellular stress ( Fregno et al., 2025 ). According to preclinical results presented at the April 2025 AD/PD conference, GT-02287 improved motor function and coordination in mouse models of GBA1 PD and sporadic PD. Treatment restored normal nest-building behaviors, which enlist both cognitive and motor skills. Effects on behavior began to be seen within hours after drug administration. Both fast (within two hours) and persistent (after 29 days) actions of the drug were associated with higher GCase activity, enhanced lysosomal and mitochondrial function, and elevated dopamine levels in the brain, as well as reduced ER stress and neuronal cell death. Improvements in movement and nesting behaviors persisted for 30 days after drug dosing was stopped, suggesting a disease-modifying effect. Treatment was associated with persistent reduction in aggregated α-synuclein, and brain biomarkers of microgliosis and astrogliosis.","Overview Name: GT-02287 Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: alpha-synuclein, Other (timeline) Condition(s): Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Parkinson's Disease (Phase 1) Company: Gain Therapeutics, Inc.",ongoing,1.0,False,,06 Jun 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/gt-02287

It is a replacement formulation for Rember ® , the first company's first proprietary formulation of methylthioninium chloride (MTC).","Background TRx0237 (LMTX™) is a second-generation tau protein aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia. It is a replacement formulation for Rember ® , the first company's first proprietary formulation of methylthioninium chloride (MTC). Both TRx0237 and Rember are derivatives of Methylene Blue, an old drug that predates the FDA and is being widely used in Africa for the treatment for malaria, as well as for methemoglobinemia and other conditions. TRx0237 and Rember share the same mode of action, but TRx0237 has been designed as a stabilized, reduced form of MTC to improve the drug's absorption, bioavailability, and tolerability. The rationale behind this approach is that these compounds prevent tau aggregation or dissolve existing aggregates to interfere with downstream pathological consequences of aberrant tau in tauopathies including Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Tau pathology is widely considered to be downstream of Aβ pathology and is more closely linked to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in the tau gene cause frontotemporal dementia, not Alzheimer's disease, but tau is considered a central drug target for all tauopathies, including Alzheimer's. Prior to the first publicized Phase 2 trial on Rember TM in 2008, one peer-reviewed paper to support this rationale had been published, which reported that Methylene Blue interfered with the tau-tau binding necessary for aggregation ( Wischik et al., 1996 ). In 2015, the same lab published on LMTX®, claiming a Ki of 0.12 micromolar for inhibition of intracellular tau aggregation, and a similar potency for disrupting tau aggregates isolated from AD brain ( Harrington et al., 2015 ). Numerous independent academic investigations of the commercially available parent compound, Methylene Blue, have reported potentially beneficial effects on a growing list of cellular and system-level endpoints, including tau fibrillization in vitro ( Crowe et al., 2013 ), autophagy (e.g. Congdon et al., 2012 ), neuroprotection via mitochondrial antioxidant properties (e.g. Wen et al., 2011 ), as well as on Aβ clearance and proteasome function in transgenic AD mouse models ( Medina et al., 2011 ), and spatial learning and brain metabolism in rats ( Deiana et al., 2009 ; Riha et al., 2011 ). One mechanistic study found that Methylene Blue oxidizes cysteine sulfhydryl groups on tau in a way that keeps tau in the monomeric state ( Feb 2013 news ). Subsequently, TRx0237’s developers reported that the inhibition of tau aggregation is cysteine-independent ( Al-Hilaly et al., 2018 ). In preclinical work, LMTX was reported to improve learning and reduced brain tau load in two strains of tau transgenic mice ( Melis et al., 2015 ). The compound increased cholinergic signaling, mitochondrial function, and expression of synaptic proteins and neuroprotection in mice ( Kondak et al., 2023 ; Schwab et al., 2024 ; Zadrozny et al., 2024 ). These effects, but not tau aggregation, were blocked by chronic pretreatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine ( Riedel et al., 2020 ; Kondak et al., 2022 ; Santos et al., 2022 ). Proteomic analysis of tau mice suggested LMTX acts via tau-dependent and -independent actions ( Schwab et al., 2021 ). These studies all originate from one lab. An independent group reported that neither Methylene Blue not LMTM protected cells in a high throughput screen for tau-mediated toxicity ( Lim et al. 2023 ). Some studies reported a generalized anti-aggregation effect for Methylene Blue against aggregation-prone proteins, such as prion protein and TDP-43 (e.g. Cavaliere et al., 2013 ; Arai et al., 2010 , Pritzkow et al., 2024 ). Other papers report no inhibition of tau- and polyglutamine-mediated neurotoxicity in vivo (see van Bebber et al., 2010 ). In mice overexpressing human α-synuclein, LMTM treatment reduced α-synuclein inclusions in the brain, and normalized movement and anxiety-related behaviors ( Schwab et al., 2017 ). It did not alter glutamate release or related behaviors in these mice ( Schwab et al., 2022) . According to a case report, an asymptomatic carrier of the P301S MAPT mutation remained cognitively stable and cerebral atrophy progressed more slowly than expected after 5 years on LMTM treatment during the expected time of onset of frontotemporal dementia symptoms ( Bentham et al., 2021 ).","Overview Name: HMTM Synonyms: LMTM, LMTX, LMT-X, TRx0237, Tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI), Methylene Blue Chemical Name: Hydromethylthionine mesylate, Leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Tau (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 3), Frontotemporal Dementia (Phase 3) Company: TauRx Therapeutics Ltd Approved for: Methylene Blue predates FDA.

Checkpoint inhibitors, including other antibodies, are approved to treat cancer, where they release tumor-induced immunosuppression and allow immune attack on malignant cells. The rationale for using PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors to treat Alzheimer’s disease stems from research stimulating the peripheral immune system to recruit regulatory T cells and monocytes to the brain to improve amyloid clearance and quell inflammation ( Baruch et al., 2015 ). Subsequent work showed that an antibody similar to the FDA-approved, anti-PD1 immunotherapy Keytruda increased infiltration of phagocytic monocytes in the 5xFAD mouse model, leading to reduced plaque load and better performance in the water maze ( Baruch et al., 2016 ). The antibody reportedly had similar effects in the DM-HTau mouse model of tauopathy, though these findings were not corroborated (see news and commentary on Rosenweig et al., 2019 ; Latta-Mahieu et al., 2017 ; Obst et al., 2018 ). In 2017, the Danish company Lundbeck announced it had acquired the rights to ImmunoBrain Checkpoint's program ( press release ). According to company disclosures, IBC-Ab002 differs from other PD-L1/PD-1 antibodies in that it has a modified Fc effector region and is more rapidly cleared from the blood. Both modifications are designed to enhance safety, as checkpoint inhibitors can cause autoimmune side effects. At the 2020 AAIC, the company reported less induction of autoimmune diabetes in susceptible mice than the unmodified antibody. In preclinical efficacy studies, a single antibody dose improved cognitive performance one month later in 5xFAD , DM-HTau (K257T/P301S), and PS19 (p301S Tau) mice. Repeatedly dosed DM-HTau mice maintained improvements in T maze behavior for at least five months (see AAIC poster ).

Defects in oxytocin biology have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders ranging from frontotemporal dementia to Huntington's disease (e.g. Bergh et al., 2022 ; Saiz-Rodgriguez et al., 2022 ). Oxytocin therapy is approved for inducing labor, controlling postpartum bleeding, and aiding breastfeeding. It is given by injection, or as an intranasal spray. Low-dose oxytocin nasal sprays are available without prescription in the U.S. Nasal oxytocin has been widely studied for its effects on social behavior. In healthy adults or people with autism, intranasal oxytocin acutely improves recognition of emotional and social cues, and enhances empathy and cooperative behavior. It can also stimulate aggressive behavior in some contexts. The nasal spray delivers oxytocin to the brain, where it is reported to last for several hours (see review by Quintana et al., 2021 ). Oxytocin is proposed as a symptomatic treatment for people with frontotemporal dementia, where damage to the frontal and temporal lobes impairs emotional processing, social cognition, and behavior. Loss of empathy is a hallmark symptom of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. These patients also show deficits in recognizing facial expressions and verbal emotional cues, and lose insight into what others think or might do. Indifference to even close family members is a major challenge for caregivers. There are no treatments for these social behavioral problems in people with FTD. However, plasma levels of oxytocin have been reported to be unrelated to social cognition or behavior in these diseases ( Johnson et al., 2022 ).

Inflammasomes are multiprotein, cytosolic complexes that function as sensors in the innate immune system. Their activation by pathologic proteins and other stressors triggers production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL1-β and IL-18, and can induce cell death. NLRP3-containing inflammasome activation occurs in many conditions where chronic inflammation plays a role, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (reviewed in Heneka et al., 2018 ). Multiple NLRP3 inhibitors are in clinical trials for a range of inflammatory diseases ( Li et al., 2023 ). NLRP3 is a receptor for Aβ, and mediates the innate immune response to amyloid in microglia, cells involved Alzheimer’s pathogenesis ( Halle et al., 2008 ). Deleting NLRP3 in the APP/PS1 mouse model diminishes Aβ deposition, synapse loss, and memory deficits ( Heneka et al., 2013 ). Loss of NLRP3 also prevents tau tangle formation in human tau-expressing mice in response to injected Aβ ( Ising et al., 2019 ). No preclinical studies using inzomelid are published. However, a related NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, blocked inflammasome activation, promoted microglial clearance of Aβ, reduced Aβ accumulation, and improved cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice ( Coll et al., 2015 ; Dempsey et al., 2017 ).

It binds the mRNA for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 and mediates its degradation. This results in lower LRRK2 protein levels. BIIB094 was being developed to treat Parkinson’s disease by Biogen. Also known as Dardarin, LRRK2 is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity. Kinase-activating mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most frequent genetic cause of inherited PD (reviewed in Schneider and Alcalay, 2020 ). Other LRRK2 variants are associated with higher risk of sporadic PD, and there is some evidence for LRRK2 kinase activation in idiopathic PD ( Di Maio et al., 2018 ). Increased LRRK2 kinase activity impairs vesicle trafficking and lysosome function, and promotes neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to PD pathogenesis (reviewed by Taylor and Alessi, 2020 ; Shutinoski et al., 2019 ; Sept 2018 news ). Multiple companies are pursing small-molecule LRRK2 inhibitors to treat PD. BIIB094 is the first antisense approach in clinical trials.

Xanomeline is an M1/M4-preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activator that acts throughout the body.,"Background KarXT is xanomeline with trospium. Xanomeline is an M1/M4-preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activator that acts throughout the body. Trospium chloride is an FDA-approved muscarinic receptor inhibitor that does not enter the central nervous system. Trospium serves to block xanomeline’s peripheral actions and reduce side effects. The rationale for muscarinic receptor agonists to treat Alzheimer’s disease is broadly supported. The decline of cholinergic function in Alzheimer's disease contributes to cognitive symptoms. Widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors modestly improve function by boosting synaptic acetylcholine levels. An alternative strategy is to directly activate receptors with agonists like xanomeline. In addition to cognitive benefits, M1 receptor activators may also modify disease progression. M1 agonists attenuate Aβ and tau pathology in animal models, and shift APP processing toward a non-amyloidogenic path (e.g., see Fisher et al., 2016 ; Caccamo et al., 2009 ). Development of these agents has been hampered by side effects related to activation of receptors outside the nervous system. Xanomeline was originally developed by Lilly in the 1990s, to treat cognitive decline in people with AD. A full agonist, it attaches to the receptor at the acetylcholine binding site. In a Phase 3 trial, 150 mg/day modestly improved ADAS-Cog scores. Unexpectedly, the drug significantly reduced behavioral symptoms and psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. However, development was halted because of dose-limiting gastrointestinal side effects of nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and hypersalivation, all attributed to activation of peripheral muscarinic receptors ( Bodick et al., 1997 ). Trospium acts on all muscarinic receptor subtypes. It is prescribed for overactive bladder, and works by relaxing bladder muscles. Its side effects include dry mouth and constipation. A similar strategy of combining a central activator and peripheral inhibitor to attenuate side effects is being pursued with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol , which is being trialed in combination with the peripherally restricted antagonist nadolol.

Ketasyn/AC-1202 was tested in Phase 1 and 2 safety/dosing trials, but in Phase 2 missed its primary endpoint and was not advanced to Phase 3 efficacy trials. Rather, in 2009 its developer, Accera Inc., since renamed Cerecin, brought it to market as a once-daily medical food called Axona. Medical foods do not undergo pre-market FDA review or approval. Unlike dietary supplements, they are not available over the counter but are prescribed by physicians. Axona is a proprietary formulation of processed coconut or other oils and glycerin. Its active ingredient is caprylic acid, along with other medium-chain triglycerides. Caprylic acid metabolism in the liver leads to substances called ""ketone bodies,"" which cross the blood-brain barrier. These have been hypothesized to provide an alternative to glucose as the brain's source of energy in conditions marked by impaired neuronal metabolism, such as Alzheimer's. Brain imaging by FDT-PET shows cerebral glucose hypometabolism in regions affected by Alzheimer's. Axona's effectiveness has been called into question by experts in the field, e.g. , Oct 2009 news series . As a result of media stories covering the controversy (e.g., ABC News ), demand for coconut oil as a cheaper source of caprylic acid rose. However, there is no scientific evidence that it is effective. On 26 December 2013, the FDA issued a warning letter charging Accera with 'false and misleading labeling.' Ketasyn, the FDA elaborated, does not meet the statutory definition of a medical food, but is instead an unapproved drug (see FDA 2013 Warning Letters ). In May 2014, Accera was subject to a related class action lawsuit before the 11th Judicial Circuit court in Florida (see Law360 story ). The company is testing other formulations of caprylic acid triglyceride for possible FDA approval (see Tricaprilin ). In October 2018, Accera re-branded itself as Cerecin, following investments from a Singapore-based agribusiness group and a private equity fund backed by Nestlé ( press release ). The company plans to market Axona in Asia-Pacific countries.","Overview Name: Ketasyn Synonyms: Axona, Caprylic Acid, AC-1202 Therapy Type: Supplement, Dietary (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 4) Status in Select Countries: Sold in the United States as a medical food.

This biologic drug recognizes Aβ(p3-42), a pyroglutamate form of Aβ that is aggregated in amyloid plaques. Most Aβ antibodies in therapeutic development bind various soluble or insoluble species but have low affinity to deposited amyloid plaques. The rationale behind donanemab is that targeting deposited plaque itself is necessary to clear existing amyloid burden from the brain, rather than merely prevent deposition of new plaques or growth of existing plaques. Some previous plaque-binding antibodies have been abandoned because they caused microhemorrhages in the brain. The mE8 antibody was reported to clear plaques in mice without causing microhemorrhages ( Demattos et al., 2012 ). At the 2014 AAIC conference, Lilly reported that a randomized preclinical study of combination therapy with N3pG and the BACE inhibitor LY2811376 cleared more than 80 percent of amyloid from the brains of PDAPP-transgenic mice, compared to about 50 percent clearance each for the respective monotherapies. Neuropathology studies showed that donanemab removed both cored and diffuse plaques (see Jul 2014 conference news ). In postmortem brain tissue from people with AD or Down's syndrome, donanemab bound to a subset of roughly one-third of amyloid plaques, and strongly reacted with the plaque core. It recognized vascular amyloid similarly to a pan-Aβ antibody. In brain tissue from AD mice, the antibody detected intraneuronal Aβ ( Bouter et al., 2022 ). The antibody bound to cerebral amyloid angiopathy fibrils isolated from human brain, in proportion to the amount of pyroglutamate-modified Aβ the fibrils contained ( Soderberg et al., 2024 ; see also Nov 2023 conference news ).

The brain uses ketones as an energy source when glucose is limited, and inducing mild ketosis has emerged as a strategy to overcome the decline in glucose uptake that occurs in people with Alzheimer’s disease. In multiple small pilot studies, ketogenic diets such as the Atkins regimen, or ketogenic supplements, improve brain energy status and cognitive function in people with MCI and AD (reviewed in Cunnane et al., 2020 ). The active components of kMCT-ONS are medium-chain triglycerides of caprylic acid and capric acid. Metabolism of these fats in the liver produces the ketones acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, which freely enter the brain. kMCT-ONS is produced by emulsifying a commercially available 60:40 mixture of the two fats derived from palm oil into lactose-free skim milk. kMCT’s composition is similar to the medicinal food Ketasyn or the experimental ketogenic drink Tricaprylin , both of which contain caprylic acid triglyceride as their main active ingredient. kMCT has been shown to increase plasma ketone levels and brain ketone uptake in healthy adults and in people with AD ( Croteau et al., 2018 ). Brain uptake of ketones does not appear to be diminished in people with AD compared to healthy people ( Castellano et al., 2015 ). A meta-analysis of trials testing medium-chain triglycerides for cognitive symptoms in older adults found a substantial increase in brain ketones and metabolic rates, but only occasional or domain-specific cognitive improvements ( Meer and Fischer 2024 ). The authors noted heterogenous and poor study design, and conflicts of interest that weakened the evidence. A meta-analysis of trials in people with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or AD likewise reported mixed outcomes for cognition ( Castro et al., 2023 ). A third meta-analysis claimed some evidence for improvement in general cognition in people with AD, but only those lacking the ApoE4 allele ( Sun et al., 2023 ). A pharmacokinetic study revealed high variability between people in blood ketone levels after an MCT dose, with major effects of meals and body fat ( Juby et al., 2021 ). In preclinical studies and one pilot clinical trial, inducing ketosis was reported to reduce amyloid load, ameliorate Aβ toxicity, and improve AD biomarkers ( Kashiwaya et al., 2013 ; Zilberter et al., 2012 ; Neth et al., 2020 ). A commercially available caprylic acid triglyceride supplement derived from coconut oil was claimed to stabilize or improve cognitive scores in most participants in a crossover study of 20 people with mild to moderate AD ( Juby et al., 2022 ). Longer treatment of up to 11 months was reportedly associated with better scores on the MMSE and a Cogstate computerized battery in this study.","Overview Name: kMCT-ONS Synonyms: medium chain triglyceride-based ketogenic oral nutritional supplement, kMCT Therapy Type: Supplement, Dietary (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Not Regulated) Company: Nestlé Health Science",unknown,,False,,19 Jul 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/kmct-ons

It acts on the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor and the gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) receptor. Both GLP-1 and GIP receptors regulate blood sugar and appetite. GLP-1 agonists are widely used to treat diabetes and obesity, and show some beneficial effects in animal models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s diseases. They have been reported to resensitize insulin signaling, normalize energy utilization, improve mitochondrial function, reduce chronic inflammation, and lengthen neuron survival. The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide is approved to treat diabetes, obesity, and sleep apnea. Several GLP1 agonists are in trials for PD or AD , but the ability of these large-peptide-derived drugs to enter the brain varies (e.g., exenatide , semaglutide , liraglutide , lixisenatide ). KP405 is a smaller, 50-amino-acid peptide that was modified to improve brain penetration ( Hölscher, 2018 ). It crosses the blood-brain barrier better than semaglutide or tirzepatide after intravenous injection in male mice ( Rhea et al., 2023 ; Salameh et al., 2020 ). KP405 reportedly improved memory, amyloid and tau pathology, synaptic and mitochondrial function, and was neuroprotective in APP/PS1 and streptozotocin models ( Cao et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2020 ). In animal models of PD, it is claimed to be more efficacious than semaglutide, liraglutide, or the exendin-4 analog NLY01 at improving motor impairment, α-synuclein pathology, dopamine neuron loss, inflammation, autophagy, and mitochondrial activity ( Zhang et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2023 ; Lv et al., 2021 ). Preclinical data presented at the April 2025 AD/PD conference claimed superiority to tirzepatide for dopamine neuron protection and inflammation.

In May 2020, the FDA approved Kynmobi for on-demand treatment of Parkinson’s OFF episodes ( company press release ). This NDA was a resubmission of an earlier application in January 2019 that the agency had rejected. Kynmobi’s active compound is apomorphine, which results from the chemical decomposition of morphine. It does not contain morphine or bind to opioid receptors. Apomorphine is used for the acute treatment of Parkinson’s symptom flare-ups called motor fluctuations. These OFF episodes plague people with advanced Parkinson’s disease who are otherwise stable on dopamine treatment. Apomorphine is usually injected subcutaneously or infused. This mode of administration requires passage through the liver and its metabolism before apomorphine reaches the brain ( Borkar et al., 2018 ). APL-130277 represents a new formulation that delivers apomorphine noninvasively, and more quickly, through the lining of the mouth, from a disintegrating strip placed under the tongue. Apomorphine's side effects include nausea and vomiting, and it is normally given along with an anti-nausea drug. Other side effects are low blood pressure leading to drowsiness and fainting. In the 2000s, low-dose, sublingual tablet formulations of apomorphine were briefly marketed for erectile dysfunction, but were discontinued when safer and more effective PDE5 inhibitors took over for that indication. In vitro, apomorphine was found to inhibit Aβ fibril formation ( Lashuel et al., 2002 ).

It is one of several reverse transcriptase inhibitors being studied for neurodegenerative diseases. It comes in tablets or solution, to be taken once or twice a day. The most common side effects in trials were headache and nausea. Interest in repurposing reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) to treat Alzheimer’s disease arose from studies implicating DNA retrotransposon activity in aging and neurodegeneration. Increasing retrotransposon activity with age leads to the accumulation of nucleic acids in the cytosol of cells. There, they activate the immune system and promote inflammation, a causative factor in age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration. Reactivation of transposon transcription has been linked to tau-driven neurodegeneration ( Guo et al., 2018 ; Ramirez et al., 2022 ; Jan 2023 news ). Nucleoside RTIs have been shown to reduce inflammation in animal models and in human clinical trials (e.g., De Cecco et al. 2019 ; Rice et al., 2018 ). One study reported intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity of nucleoside RTIs, independent of reverse transcriptase ( Fowler et al., 2014 ). Multiple RTIs are in trials for AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy, due to their ability to quiet inflammation ( TPN-101 , Emtricitabine ), or to modulate cholesterol metabolism ( Efavirenz ). In preclinical studies, lamivudine reduced retrotransposon activity and neurodegeneration in fly and mouse tauopathy models ( Sun et al., 2018 ; Vallés-Saiz et al., 2023 ; Wahl et al., 2023 ), and in reprogrammed neurons from people with AD ( Sun et al., 2024 ). It modulated tau-induced expression of immune- and inflammation-related genes in mouse hippocampus ( Wahl et al., 2024 ), and improved memory in mouse models of Down’s syndrome or accelerated aging ( Martinez de Lagran et al., 2022 ; Li et al., 2021 ). The RTI stavudine/D4T was reported to suppress neurodegeneration, measured in part via lifespan and dendritic collapse, in fruit fly models of TDP-43 toxicity or frontotemporal dementia ( Krug et al, 2017 ; Fort-Aznar et al., 2020 ). Stavudine was reported to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in blood cells from Alzheimer’s patients, and to stimulate Aβ autophagy by macrophages in vitro ( La Rosa et al., 2022 ; La Rosa et al., 2019 ).

In June 2018, this antibody received orphan drug designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia. Sortilin is a type I membrane glycoprotein in the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein (Vps10p) family. Sortilin is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. As a sorting receptor in the trans-Golgi network, sortilin is involved in neurotrophin signaling, lysosomal degradation, and APP metabolism. Sortilin regulates the endocytosis and degradation of progranulin, and this process has been implicated in FTD pathophysiology ( Hu et al., 2010 ). Progranulin mutations are a leading cause of frontotemporal dementia, and are associated with 50 to 70 percent reduction in progranulin protein levels. Blocking sortilin with AL001 is a strategy to increase progranulin levels. The SORL1 gene is one of the strongest genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, and is associated with frontotemporal dementia, as well ( Rogaeva et al., 2007 ; Pottier et al., 2012 ; Holstege et al., 2017 ; Raghavan et al., 2018 ; Pallesen and Vægter et al., 2012 ; Philtjens et al., 2018 ). Targeting the sortilin-progranulin axis was reported to improve outcomes associated with progranulin insufficiency in preclinical models ( Lee et al., 2013 ). In cell assays, latozinemab blocked the interaction of sortilin with progranulin, reduced sortilin protein levels, and increased progranulin. In a mouse model of FTD-PGN, a rodent cross-reactive form of AL001 decreased sortilin levels in white blood cells, restored plasma progranulin to normal levels, and rescued a social behavior deficit. In cynomolgus monkeys, latozinemab decreased sortilin levels in blood cells, and increased plasma and CSF progranulin by two to three times ( Kurnellas et al., 2023 ).","Overview Name: Latozinemab Synonyms: AL001, GSK4527223 Therapy Type: Immunotherapy (passive) (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Frontotemporal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis U.S. FDA Status: Frontotemporal Dementia (Discontinued), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Inactive) Company: Alector, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)",discontinued,,False,,13 Nov 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/latozinemab

This therapeutic antibody grew out of the discovery of the “Arctic” mutation in APP, which leads to a form of clinically typical Alzheimer's disease that is marked by particularly high levels of Aβ protofibrils and relative absence of amyloid plaques (see Nilsberth et al., 2001 ). mAb158 was originally developed at Uppsala University, Sweden ( Englund et al., 2007 ). In its preclinical development, mAb158 was found to reduce Aβ protofibrils in brain and CSF of Tg-ArcSwe mice ( Lord et al., 2009 ; Tucker et al., 2015 ). Subsequent studies in mouse neuron-glial co-cultures showed that mAb158 may protect neurons, i.e., reduce Aβ protofibril toxicity, by counteracting the pathological accumulation of these protofibrils in astrocytes ( Söllvander et al., 2018 ). In a direct comparison with the anti-amyloid antibodies aducanumab and gantenerumab , lecanemab was reported to bind most strongly to Aβ protofibrils, while the others preferred more highly aggregated forms ( Nov 2021 conference news ). Lecanemab was shown to bind to diffusible Aβ fibrils and protofibrils from human brain tissue ( Nov 2022 news ; Johannesson et al., 2024 ; Fertan et al., 2025 ). Two studies reported it bound to cerebral amyloid angiopathy fibrils less avidly than other Aβ antibodies ( Soderberg et al., 2024 ; Peralta Reyes et al., 2025 ), but another study did not replicate that result ( Butler et al., 2025 preprint ). The antibody captured more protofibrils in CSF from people with mild cognitive impairment or AD compared to cognitively normal people ( Noguchi-Shinohara et al., 2025 ). In aged Tg2576 mice, mAb158 lowered Aβ protofibrils within four weeks, and later reduced Aβ plaques; both effects reversed after treatment was stopped ( Rizoska et al., 2024 ). Lecanemab was also reported to interfere with the binding of Aβ protofibrils to fibrinogen, which may offer additional protection against clotting abnormalities and synaptotoxicity that occur in AD ( Singh et al., 2024 ). Subsequently, the antibody was found to bind fibrinogen in plasma ( Bellier et al., 2024 ). BAN2401 was licensed to Eisai, which in March 2014 signed a collaboration agreement with Biogen for joint development of this therapeutic antibody. Preclinical research with postmortem Down's syndrome brain sections indicates binding of lecanemab to Aβ deposits in this disease, as well ( Johannesson et al., 2021 ). In another study of postmortem tissue from 15 people with Down's, lecanemab bound extensively to both amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid ( Liu et al., 2024 ). A hexavalent antibody based on mAb158 was being developed, with the goal of enhancing binding strength selectively to Aβ protofibrils ( Rofo et al., 2021 ). Preclinical work has been reported on a brain shuttle form of lecanemab as well. Bi-lecanemab contains a transferrin receptor binding domain, and was shown to broadly distribute in the brains of amyloid-bearing mice ( Syvänen et al., 2018 ). According to data presented at the April 2025 AD/PD conference, the antibody preferentially binds to plaques in mouse brain ( Apr 2025 news ).","Overview Name: Leqembi Synonyms: Leqembi Iqlik , Lecanemab-irmb, BAN2401, mAb158 Therapy Type: Immunotherapy (passive) (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Approved) Company: BioArctic AB, Biogen, Eisai Co., Ltd.",approved,3.0,False,3.0,19 Oct 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/leqembi

Abnormally active DYRK1A has been implicated in memory and learning problems in Alzheimer’s disease and Down's syndrome. Taken in tablet form, this drug is claimed to cross the blood-brain barrier. Dyrk1 has been found to regulate alternative splicing of tau exon 10 ( Qian et al., 2011 ; Yin et al., 2012 ). For a review of tau isoforms in Alzheimer’s and related diseases, see Buchholz and Zempel, 2024 ). In AD, proteases cleave full-length DYRK1A into a more stable and active kinase. Many substrates have been identified, including tau at residue 212 ( Kimura et al., 2007 ), but also APP, presenilin, and other synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins. Excess DYRK1A activity has been shown to dysregulate tau splicing to favor the 3R isoform ( Yin et al., 2017 ). In Down's syndrome, DYRK1A is overexpressed due to the presence of the gene in the trisomy region of chromosome 21. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of DYRK1A has been reported to reduce pathology or improve cognition in AD and DS rodent models (e.g. Velazquez et al., 2019 ; Branca et al.., 2017 ; see Meijer et al., 2024 for comprehensive listing).

Leuprolide is one of several androgen deprivation drugs used to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in fertility regimens, for severe endometriosis and uterine fibroids, and to prevent precocious puberty in children. The rationale behind repurposing leuprolide for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is based on the hypothesis that LH, which becomes elevated later in life and in some people with Alzheimer's ( Short et al., 2001 ), induces post-mitotic neurons to re-enter the cell cycle, leading to cell death and cognitive decline ( Atwood and Bowen, 2015 ). Medicare hospitalization claims data were reported to support a protective effect on cognition ( Smith et al., 2018 ). Other studies have linked androgen deprivation therapy used in men with prostate cancer to a higher risk of subsequent dementia ( Jayadevappa et al., 2019 ).

It was developed for the treatment of epilepsy but, as a pyrrolidone acetamide, is chemically unrelated to most other anti-convulsives. Levetiracetam is available as an oral syrup, an intravenous infusion, and immediate- and extended-release tablets. Generic equivalents of these formulations are on the market as well, and the drug is widely used. Its side effects include sleepiness, headache, lack of energy, and others. This compound's mechanism of action is not fully understood. It does not act on the GABAergic system and is inactive at classic receptor sites linked to epileptic seizures, such as amino-acid-related receptors, adenosine receptors, and ion channels ( Sills et al., 1997 ). Early on, inhibition of calcium signaling or depolarizing currents were proposed as possible mechanisms of action ( Margineanu and Wülfert, 1997 ). In recent years, Alzheimer’s research has characterized Aβ-induced hyperactivation, aberrant network activity, and nonconvulsive seizure phenotypes in the J20 , APP23 , APP/PS1 , and certain strains of Tg2576 transgenic mouse models of AD amyloidosis ( Sep 2007 news ; Lalonde et al., 2005 ; Minkeviciene et al., 2009 ; Shi et al., 2013 ). In J20 mice, levetiracetam was reported to quiet epileptiform activity in circuits of the medial temporal lobe network, as well as reverse hyperactivity in behavioral assays and deficits in spatial learning assays ( Aug 2012 news ). It was also claimed to normalize microglia phenotypes ( Das et al., 2021 ). Low doses of the drug reportedly reduced hippocampal hyperactivation and improved memory performance in an aging rat model ( Koh et al., 2010 ). In APP knock-in mice, chronic administration of levetiracetam was reported to reduce levels of Aβ42, the β-carboxyl-terminal fragment but not full-length APP, reduce plaque burden, and restore levels of presynaptic endocytic proteins ( Rao and Savas, 2021 ). In rigorous preclinical animal testing, levetiracetam induced changes in gene expression and metabolism in the same brain areas where it modified glucose uptake ( Onos et al., 2022 ). No effects on cognition were found. In other preclinical studies, levetiracetam normalized hippocampal gamma oscillations that were disturbed by Aβ ( Isla et al., 2023 ). In humans, observational research has linked hippocampal hyperactivity and nonconvulsive seizures to cognitive decline in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, such as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, Dec 2011 news ; Jul 2013 news ; Vossel et al., 2016 ). Further studies reported that seizures or subclinical epileptiform brain activity in people with AD coincide with faster loss of cognitive capabilities and more severe disease ( Horvath et al., 2021 ; Voglein et al., 2020 ). A proprietary, low-dose formulation of levetiracetam, AGB101 , failed a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating its ability to improve cognition and slow disease progression in people with MCI and AD.

Levodopa is formulated with carbidopa, a decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the conversion to dopamine in peripheral tissues. This helps prevent the nausea and vomiting produced by levodopa alone, and enables delivery of higher doses to the brain. Besides nausea, other common side effects are low blood pressure, confusion, and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias. Levodopa can also cause sudden onset of sleep, hallucinations, and increased risk-taking behavior. Over time, many patients on levodopa experience the intermittent return of symptoms. These periods are known as motor fluctuations or OFF periods, when the medication stops working between doses. This may be due to the progressive loss of dopamine neurons, or impaired absorption of drug as the disease advances.

GLP-1 is a hormone that is produced in the gut and activates receptors in the gut, liver, and pancreas to control blood-sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance. Liraglutide and related GLP-1 mimetics cause body weight loss and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, stroke, and dementia in people with diabetes. GLP-1 crosses the blood-brain barrier and may improve insulin signaling in the brain ( Hölscher, 2018 ). GLP‐1 was also reported to promote hippocampal synaptic plasticity, cognition, and cell survival ( During et al., 2003 ). Diabetes, high blood sugar, and insulin resistance are all associated with dementia. In Alzheimer’s disease, there is evidence for insulin resistance in the brain. Thus, there has been much interest in testing liraglutide and other GLP-1 analogs, such as exendin-4 , semaglutide , and lixisenatide , as potential therapeutics for AD. Liraglutide has been tested in preclinical AD models. In the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse, liraglutide reduced amyloid deposition, glial activation, and synapse loss, increased neurogenesis, and improved memory ( McClean et al., 2011 ). Memory reportedly improved regardless of whether liraglutide was given before or after amyloid plaques were established ( McClean and Hölscher, 2013 ; McClean et al., 2015 ). The same group reported improvements in cerebral blood vessel structure in liraglutide-treated AD mice, resulting in fewer microaneurysms, and less vascular leakage ( Kelly et al., 2015 ). A different group found no effect of liraglutide on amyloid load in the same APP/PS1 model, and one other transgenic model ( Hansen et al., 2016 ). In a mixed model of AD and Type 2 diabetes, liraglutide improved insulin levels, and reduced brain atrophy, amyloid plaque, Aβ aggregates, and tau phosphorylation, while improving cognition ( Carranza-Naval et al., 2021 ). Liraglutide reduced tau pathology and cognitive impairment in two different models, APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic mice and mice with Aβ oligomers infused into the brain ( Chen et al., 2017 ; Qi et al., 2016 ). In mice expressing mutated human tau, the drug reduced phosphorylation of tau and improved a motor phenotype ( Hansen et al., 2016 ). It lessened tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ overproduction, and normalized insulin signaling in rats with high blood homocysteine, a risk factor for AD ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). In nonhuman primates, liraglutide partially restored a loss of insulin receptors and synapses caused by Aβ oligomer infusion into the brain ( Batista et al., 2018 ). Liraglutide also shows activity in mouse models of Parkinson's disease ( Liu et al., 2015 ; Hansen et al., 2016 ; Badawi et al., 2017 ), stroke ( He et al., 2020 ), spinal cord injury ( Zhang et al., 2020 ), and traumatic brain injury ( Bader et al., 2019 ). Among GLP-1 mimetics, liraglutide appears to enter the brain poorly ( Salameh et al., 2020 ). A peptide drug, liraglutide is injected once a day using a prefilled disposable pen. Gastrointestinal side effects are common, including nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, indigestion, and constipation. Liraglutide can cause hypoglycemia and dizziness. In mice and rats, liraglutide caused thyroid tumors, and it should not be taken by people at risk for thyroid cancer.","Overview Name: Liraglutide Synonyms: Victoza™, Saxenda™ Therapy Type: Other Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2) Company: Novo Nordisk A/S Approved for: Diabetes, weight loss",ongoing,2.0,False,,23 Sep 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/liraglutide

Common side effects are nausea, excessive thirst and urination, tremor, weight gain, and cognitive dulling. It is not sedating. The therapeutic window is narrow, and use requires regular monitoring of blood lithium levels. Older adults experience toxicity at lower blood levels than younger people, and thus are prescribed lower doses. Lithium is a positively charged ion, and is formulated as a salt with various counterions. Lithium carbonate and citrate are the most common, while chloride, aspartate, sulfate, and gluconate are less used. Low-dose lithium complexed with orotic acid is available over the counter as a dietary supplement. Lithium orotate has been claimed to be more brain-penetrant than other lithium salts ( Pacholko and Bekar, 2021 ). Lithium’s mechanism of action is not fully understood, and it likely modulates multiple pathways. Interest in repurposing for neurodegeneration stemmed from the discovery of lithium’s ability to inhibit glycogen synthetase kinase 3 (GSK3), a key regulator of amyloid and tau pathology. In mouse models of tauopathy and AD, lithium was shown to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid production ( Noble et al., 2005 ; Zhang et al., 2011 ). In multiple preclinical models of Alzheimer’s disease, even low doses of lithium were able to reduce amyloid plaques, boost neuron survival, improve memory, and decrease neuroinflammation (reviewed in De-Paula et al., 2025 ). Various effects claimed in animal models of AD or Parkinson’s disease include reductions in neuroinflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial impairment, and improved energy metabolism, neurotrophic factor production, synaptic plasticity, or neuroprotection (reviewed by Singulani et al., 2024 ). Intranasal delivery of lithium is being investigated in preclinical models as a way to increase brain levels and decrease blood levels compared to peripheral administration ( Bhuiyan et al., 2025 ). Epidemiological studies raised the prospect that lithium can prevent dementia. In people with bipolar disorder, lithium treatment is associated with lower rates of dementia compared to no treatment or other mood stabilizers ( Kessing et al., 2010 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). In Denmark, regions with naturally higher trace lithium levels in drinking water had lower dementia rates ( Kessing et al., 2017 ). Similar results were reported for AD dementia, and in other regions ( Fajardo et al., 2018 ; Fraiha-Pegado et al., 2024 ). However, these results were not universal (e.g., Parker et al., 2018 ), and the mechanism by which long-term exposure to very low levels of lithium might prevent dementia is not clear. Recent work reported a reduction in lithium content in the prefrontal cortex of people with mild cognitive impairment or AD, along with binding of lithium to amyloid plaques ( Aug 2025 news on Aron et al., 2025 ).

GLP-1 stimulates the pancreas to release insulin in response to food intake.,"Background Lixisenatide is an analog of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. GLP-1 stimulates the pancreas to release insulin in response to food intake. GLP-1 mimetics resensitize cells to insulin signaling and are used to treat Type 2 diabetes. Several GLP-1 mimetics are also approved for weight loss. The FDA approved Adlyxin for Type 2 diabetes in 2016, but Sanofi discontinued marketing it for this disease in 2023, citing business reasons. Lixisenatide is taken as a once-daily self-injection under the skin. Lixisenatide is one of four GLP-1 mimetics being tested for Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases. It is a 44-amino acid peptide closely related to exenatide ( Leon et al., 2017 ). Lixisenatide appears to cross the blood-brain barrier better than liraglutide and semaglutide ( Hunter and Hölscher, 2012 ; Salameh et al., 2020 ). The rationale of using GLP-1 receptor agonists for neurodegeneration stems from observations of insulin resistance in some cases of Alzheimer's disease (e.g. Talbot et al., 2012 ; Talbot, 2014 ). Type 2 diabetes raises the risk of Parkinson’s, and in some studies, the prevalence of Parkinson’s was lower in people with diabetes who were treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to those taking other diabetes medications ( Brauer et al., 2020 ; Svenningsson et al., 2016 ). GLP-1 mimetics are neuroprotective in preclinical models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (e.g. Perry et al., 2002 ; Bertilsson et al., 2008 ; Li et al., 2010 ). Potential mechanisms of neuroprotection by GLP-1 mimetics include reduced inflammation (reviewed in Reich and Hölscher, 2022 ). Preclinically, lixisenatide reduced Aβ-induced impairments in spatial learning and memory in rats, and was neuroprotective in APP/PS1/tau mice ( Cai et al., 2014 ; Cai et al., 2017 ; Cai et al., 2018 ). In the APPswe/PS1Δe9 mouse line, it improved object recognition and synaptic plasticity, prevented synapse loss, reduced amyloid load and microglial activation, and increased neurogenesis, all at lower doses than liraglutide ( McClean and Hölscher, 2014 ; Hölscher, 2014 ). In the MPTP toxin-induced mouse model of Parkinson's lixisenatide prevented motor impairment and dopamine neuron loss ( Liu et al., 2015 ).

P75NTF binds nerve growth factor, brain-derived growth factor, and other neurotrophins. Its signaling can promote either neuron survival or death by apoptosis, depending on its ligand and cellular context. In AD models, P75NTF mediates neurotoxic effects of Aβ ( Sotthibundhu et al., 2008 ; Knowles et al., 2009 ). LM11A-31 selectively activates p75NTF survival pathways and inhibits apoptosis signaling ( Massa et al., 2006) . It blocks Aβ-induced neurodegeneration and synaptic impairment in neuronal and hippocampal slice cultures ( Yang et al., 2008 ). Its neuroprotective actions are not specific for Aβ, as it also counteracts toxicity of anticancer drugs on neurons in culture ( James et al., 2008 ). LM11A-31 has been studied in multiple mouse models of AD, where it prevented tau phosphorylation and misfolding, microglia and astrocyte activation, loss of cholinergic neurites, and cognitive decline ( Knowles et al., 2013 ; Nguyen et al., 2014 ). It reduced tau pathology in mice expressing amyloid precursor protein or the P301L tau mutant ( Yang et al., 2020 ; Yang et al., 2020 ). In mouse models with cholinergic neuron deficits, treatment induced recovery of dendrites ( Simmons et al., 2014 ). In normal mice, LM11A-31 suppressed cholinergic loss during aging ( Xie et al., 2019 ). LM11A-31 was reported to show efficacy in mouse models of Huntington’s disease ( Simmons et al., 2016 ), traumatic brain or spinal cord injury ( Haefeli et al., 2017 ; Shi et al., 2013 ; Tep et al., 2013 ), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( Friesland et al., 2014 ), HIV-induced neurodegeneration ( Xie et al., 2021 , Killebrew et al., 2021 ), peripheral nerve injury ( McGregor et al., 2021 , Aby et al., 2021 ), and acute stroke ( Nasoohi et al., 2023 ; Nguyen et al., 2022 ). In other rodent models, it reduced cognitive impairment caused by sepsis-induced neuroinflammation in mice ( Ji et al., 2018 ), and reduced excessive alcohol intake in rats ( Darcq et al., 2016 ). LM11A-31 has been evaluated in mouse models of strep meningitis and of erectile dysfunction, and in cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus ( Zhang et al., 2021 , Yin et al., 2021 , Fogle et al., 2021 ).

It reduces the risk of stroke in people with hypertension and an enlarged heart.,"Background Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker used to treat high blood pressure. It reduces the risk of stroke in people with hypertension and an enlarged heart. It is also used to protect against kidney damage due to diabetes. Approved in 1995, losartan is available in branded and generic forms. In 2017, it was the ninth-most-prescribed medication in the U.S. Common side effects include muscle cramps, stuffy nose, dizziness, and back pain. Losartan crosses the blood-brain barrier. Managing hypertension with medications reduces the risk of mild cognitive impairment ( Jan 2019 news ). Losartan other angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) act on the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure in the body and the brain. Angiotensin II receptors also mediate inflammation, blood-brain barrier maintenance, and neuron survival. Genetic, epidemiologic, and biological evidence implicates changes in the brain renin-angiotensin system in Alzheimer’s disease (reviewed in Kehoe, 2018 ). ARB use is associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD, which may be independent of lowered blood pressure (e.g., Wharton et al., 2015 ; Barthold et al., 2018 ; also see Walker et al., 2020 ). ). However, meta-analyses do not support a benefit of ARBs over other classes of antihypertensives in preventing cognitive decline or dementia ( Peters et al., 2020 ; Ding et al., 2020 ). In people with mild cognitive impairment, use of ARBs, but not other antihypertensives, was linked to lower brain amyloid load and CSF tau ( Hajjar et al., 2012 ; Hajjar et al., 2015 ). In animal models of AD, losartan given systemically attenuates brain inflammation and cognitive impairment, without affecting soluble Aβ or plaque load (e.g., Ongali et al., 2014 ). In other studies, intranasal or intraperitoneal losartan reduced Aβ plaques and inflammatory markers and stimulated neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice, but no behavioral data were reported ( Danielyan et al., 2010 ; Drews et al., 2021 ). In mice expressing a variant of the angiotensin-converting enzyme that raises the risk of AD in people, losartan prevented neurodegeneration ( Oct 2020 news ). In other preclinical work, losartan reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice ( Ababei et al., 2019 ), and reduced inflammation, perivascular Aβ deposits, and neurological deficits in hypertensive rats ( Drews et al., 2019 ). Losartan also reportedly inhibits platelet-mediated Aβ aggregation, a possible contributor to cerebral amyloidosis ( Donner et al., 2020 ). Some animal studies suggest that losartan’s cognitive benefits depend on activation of the angiotensin IV receptor, which occurs downstream of angiotensin II receptor inhibition ( Royea et al., 2017 ; Royea et al., 2020 ). In Drosophila, losartan mitigated the toxicity of Aβ or a presenilin mutation independently of the renin-angiotensin pathway ( Lee et al., 2021 ).","Overview Name: Losartan Synonyms: Cozaar®, MK0954 Chemical Name: 2-butyl-5-chloro-3-[[4-[2-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl]phenyl]methyl]imidazol-4-yl]methanol Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2) Company: Merck Approved for: Hypertension, diabetic neuropathy",ongoing,2.0,False,,04 Nov 2021,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/losartan

It increases the number and activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress inflammation.,"Background Low dose interleukin 2 is being tested as an immunomodulatory approach in neurodegenerative diseases. It increases the number and activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress inflammation. At high doses, IL-2 stimulates the immune response to tumors, and is approved for treating cancer. Treg-mediated immune control appears to be compromised in people with AD ( Faridar et al., 2020 ). In preclinical studies, Tregs that were transferred into AD mice entered the brain and stopped Aβ plaque growth ( Faridar et al., 2022 ). Multiple labs have reported that low dose IL-2 induces expansion of Treg cells, decreases hippocampal Aβ plaque load, and lessens memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice ( Dansokho et al., 2016 ; Alves et al., 2017 ; Yuan et al., 2023 ). Tregs also play a role in ALS and in Parkinson’s disease. In people with ALS, an observed decline in Tregs correlated with faster disease progression. In the SOD1 mouse model of ALS, giving IL-2 or Tregs resulted in motor neuron preservation, less spinal cord inflammation, and longer survival ( Sheean et al., 2018 ; Banerjee et al., 2008 ). A Phase 1 study in ALS patients demonstrated reduction in markers of oxidative stress and inflammation after Treg infusion ( Beers et al., 2022 ). In PD patients, reductions in Treg number and function correlated with proinflammatory T cell activation, and increases in Tregs were associated with improved clinical measures ( Thome et al., 2021 ; Arce-Sillas et al., 2024 ). Administration of low dose IL-2 led to Treg expansion in a mouse model of PD ( Markovic et al., 2022 ). In other preclinical studies, transplantation or expansion of Tregs was neuroprotective in rodent models of PD ( Reynolds et al., 2010 ; Badr et al., 2022 ; Park et al., 2023 ).","Overview Name: Low Dose Interleukin-2 Synonyms: COYA 301, Aldesleukin, Proleukin, ld IL-2 Therapy Type: Other Target Type: Inflammation (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Phase 3) Company: Coya Therapeutics",ongoing,3.0,True,,11 Mar 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/low-dose-interleukin-2

It uses mid- or low-frequency sound waves delivered from arrays applied to the outside of the head to change activity in brain circuits. Low-frequency waves penetrate deep into the brain, allowing modulation of structures important in Alzheimer’s disease such as the hippocampus. Targeting can be achieved with millimeter precision using concurrent magnetic resonance imaging or image-guided neuronavigation. Treatment may target a single brain region, or multiple sites in the brain. Work in primates and humans established that low-intensity ultrasound can inhibit or enhance neural activity in superficial and deep brain regions (e.g., Folloni et al., 2019 ; Legon et al., 2014 ; Lee et al., 2015 ; reviewed in Meng et al., 2021 ). This procedure in healthy older adults has been shown to increase blood flow, neural activity, and functional connectivity in deep brain regions ( Kuhn et al., 2023 ). For a review of human studies and discussion of ultrasound parameters, see Lee et al., 2024 . With low-intensity ultrasound, neuromodulation occurs with disrupting the blood brain barrier. In this way, LIFU differs from protocols that pair focused ultrasound with injected microbubble contrast agents to open the BBB and stimulate amyloid plaque removal ( Focused Ultrasound – BBB ). The mechanism of neuromodulation remains to be clarified, but may include transient hyperthermia or activation of pressure-sensitive receptors, resulting in improved blood flow, induction of neurotrophic factors, or synaptic regulation (reviewed in Meng et al. 2021 ). LIFU also affects the activity of microglia and the immune system ( Grewal et al., 2023 ). In preclinical work, scanning ultrasound delivered across the brains of old mice improved performance in a foot shock avoidance task ( Blackmore et al., 2021 ; Jun 2021 news ). The treatment reversed the age-related decline in hippocampal long-term potentiation in the mice, and boosted neurogenesis. In APP23 mice, high- or low-frequency scanning ultrasound improved learning, without opening the blood-brain barrier, and without reducing plaque ( Leinenga et al., 2024 ; see also review in Leinenga et al., 2024 ). In a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, transcranial low-intensity ultrasound decreased motor cortex excitability, and was anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective ( Wang et al., 2020 ; Song et al., 2022 ; for review see Zhong et al., 2023 ).","Overview Name: Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Synonyms: LIFU, transcranial focused ultrasound, tFUS, MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) Therapy Type: Procedural Intervention Target Type: Other (timeline) , Unknown Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 3), Mild Cognitive Impairment (Phase 2), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2)",ongoing,3.0,True,,22 Sep 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/low-intensity-focused-ultrasound

The serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus with APOE2 cDNA is surgically injected into the spinal canal so that it reaches the cerebrospinal fluid and brain. APOE gene isoforms strongly affect the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. APOE4 raises the risk, APOE2 reduces it. APOE4 is associated with acceleration of amyloid accumulation in the brain compared with other isoforms; E2 protects against pathology (e.g., Reiman et al., 2020 ). The rationale for gene therapy is to increase the expression of E2, and overcome the harmful effects of E4. In preclinical work, AAVrh.10-APOE2 was tested in mice expressing human APP, PS1, and APOE4. Intracerebral delivery of the virus led to widespread brain expression of APOE2, and decreased Aβ levels and amyloid deposition ( Zhao et al., 2016 ). APOE2 gene therapy reduced amyloid most effectively when given before plaque accumulation began. A separate study also reported reduced Aβ plaque deposition, neurodegenerative synaptic loss, and microglial activation in an APP/PS1 mouse model despite continued expression of human APOE ε4 ( Jackson et al., 2024 ). Other researchers reported that gene therapy using liposome-based delivery of ApoE2 plasmids to mouse brain reduced levels of insoluble Aβ, but increased soluble oligomers, enhanced neurite dystrophy, and decreased synaptic protein levels ( Wang et al., 2024 ). Studies using nonhuman primates compared APOE2 expression in brain two months after intraparenchymal, intracisternal, or intraventricular delivery of AAVrh.10-APOE2. Intracisternal delivery was the safest and resulted in widespread brain expression of APOE2 ( Rosenberg et al., 2018 ). Lexeo has two additional gene therapy candidates in preclinical development. LX1021 expresses ApoE2 with the protective Christchurch mutation ( Günaydin et al., 2024 ).

Progranulin mutations are a frequent cause of familial frontotemporal dementia. Mutations result in 30 to 50 percent reductions in cerebrospinal fluid progranulin levels compared to the normal range. The loss of progranulin interferes with proper lysosomal function, leading to build-up of toxic proteins, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration (e.g., Sep 2017 news ). GRN is also implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Variants that reduce progranulin levels increase risk of AD, and progranulin reduction exacerbates AD pathology in animal models (reviewed in Elia et al., 2020 ). PR006 is delivered as a one-time injection into the cerebrospinal fluid in the cisterna magna at the base of the brain. At conferences, company scientists reported that PR006 increased progranulin release and improved lysosomal function of neurons derived from FTD-GRN patients, that PR006 restored brain GRN expression and progranulin secretion into the CSF in progranulin knockout mice, and that PR006 appeared safe and resulted in broad progranulin expression in the brain and periphery in nonhuman primates (see Nov 2019 news ). This preclinical data have since been published ( Sevigny et al., 2024 ), as was evidence that PR006 normalized lysosomal markers and reduced CNS inflammatory markers in the knockout mice. Separately, one study reported T cell infiltration, as well as ependymal and hippocampal toxicity, following supra-physiological expression of progranulin from an AAV9-GRN delivered to GRN knockout mice. Some of this toxicity was also seen with progranulin overexpression in wild-type ( Amado et al., 2019 ). A second study comparing several AAV-GRN constructs in progranulin knockout mice and nonhuman primates reported no such toxicity ( Hinderer et al., 2020 ).

No information is available about the makeup of LY3954068. In general, siRNAs are double-stranded RNA molecules about 20 to 25 nucleotides long, which bind to complementary sequences on mRNA and induce RNA interference, resulting in degradation of target mRNAs. As such, LY3954068 is designed to reduce the levels of tau protein. This strategy assumes that decreasing the abundance of tau will slow the formation of tau aggregates and progression of tau pathology. LY3954068 is being studied for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. No preclinical work is published on LY3954068. More generally, one published study tested the effects of a MAPT siRNA delivered directly to the brains of P301S tau-expressing mice. After a single injection, the siRNA partially spread through the hippocampus and suppressed tau expression, with no signs of neurotoxicity or neuroinflammation ( Xu et al., 2014 ). MAPT siRNA improved recovery after spinal cord injury in rats ( Chen et al., 2023 ). However, another study claimed it impaired the migration of Schwann cells after nerve injury in rats, interfered with cytoskeletal protein expression and distribution, and compromised myelin and lipid debris clearance in these cells ( Yi et al., 2019 ). An alternative approach to reducing tau expression uses antisense oligonucleotides to block mRNA translation ( DeVos et al., 2013 ; DeVos et al., 2017 ).

Rather, MEDI1814 development will focus on CNS compartments (personal communication). MEDI1841 is an IgG1 specific for the C-terminus of Aβ42. A triple mutation in its Fc region weakens binding to microglia, a strategy to avoid ARIA ( Nov 2015 news ). No peer-reviewed preclinical data on this antibody has been published. According to meeting abstracts, the antibody, delivered either into the brain or systemically, prevented synaptic toxicity induced by administration of Aβ42 aggregates in rats ( Ondrejcak et al., 2017 ). MEDI1814 was also reported to increase total and decrease free CSF Aβ42 in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys ( Billinton et al., 2017 ).","Overview Name: MEDI1814 Therapy Type: Immunotherapy (passive) (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly & Co.",discontinued,,False,,28 Jun 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/medi1814

The device consists of a cap with eight embedded transmitters and a control box worn in an arm strap. It produces electromagnetic waves in the 1,000 MHz range that penetrate the skull and underlying brain areas. The exposure is similar to that associated with cellphone use. Patients wear the device at home for two hours a day. They experience no sound or sensation associated with it, and can move around freely. The primary mechanism of action is claimed to be disaggregation of toxic Aβ and tau oligomers. In preclinical work, two to eight months of exposure to electromagnetic waves at 918 MHz for two hours daily increased performance on several cognitive tests in AβPPsw transgenic Alzheimer’s mice, increased memory in 24- to 27-month-old transgenic mice, and reduced Aβ deposition ( Arendash et al., 2010 ; Arendash et al., 2012 ). The treatment also improved cognitive performance in normal mice. It reduced regional blood flow in cerebral cortex. In AD mice and in vitro, TEMT disrupted Aβ oligomers, and increased mitochondrial function and neuronal activity ( Dragicevic et al., 2011 ; also see Arendash 2012 for review). This work was carried out by one group. Independent groups have reported benefits of radiofrequency exposure on cognition and pathology in AD mouse models (e.g. Babaceur et al., 2013 ; Son et al., 2018 ), and in people ( Guerriero et al., 2015 ), albeit using different stimulation parameters.

It lowers blood glucose and restores insulin sensitivity.,"Background Metformin is a prescription drug widely used to treat Type 2 diabetes. It lowers blood glucose and restores insulin sensitivity. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia, and insulin sensitivity may be altered in Alzheimer's patients. Metformin has been reported to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and to promote neurogenesis. Its ability to stimulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been linked to anti-aging activity in animal models, but also to increased Aβ generation via upregulation of BACE1. In people, metformin use is associated with reduced mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, independent of its effects on diabetes ( Campbell et al., 2017 ). This has led some to promote it as a potential anti-aging drug in people ( Barzilai et al., 2016 ). Some epidemiological studies suggest metformin reduces Alzheimer's risk in people using it to treat diabetes, but others have found long-term use may increase it. Long-term metformin use can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause symptoms of dementia ( Campbell et al., 2018 ; Chin-Hsiao, 2019 ; Sluggett et al., 2020 ; Imfeld et al., 2012 ; Porter et al., 2019 ). More recent, and larger, studies bear out a reduction in all-cause dementia in people with diabetes who use metformin, and indicate a dose-response relationship (e.g., Doran et al., 2024 ; Sun et al., 2023 ; Zimmerman et al., 2023 ). This finding is not universal (see Wu et al., 2024 ). In one study, metformin effects varied among subgroups defined by use of antidepressants, NSAIDs, or with neuropsychiatric disorders ( Tang et al., 2024 ). Likewise, results for studies of metformin in Alzheimer’s disease are mixed. One meta-analysis of published studies suggested a reduced risk of cognitive decline, but not of Alzheimer’s, in people with diabetes who used metformin ( Zhang et al., 2022 ). Other studies found no reduction of AD risk or slowing of decline in people with AD ( Luo et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2020 ; Xue and Xie, 2023 ). One study reported the potential for a higher risk of AD among Asians using metformin ( Ha et al., 2021 ). In an autopsy study of 1,584 participants, there was no difference in the level of AD pathology or evidence of strokes between metformin users and non-users ( Sood et al., 2024 ). Among positive studies, metformin was associated with a reduced risk of all types of dementia, but only if it was initiated before dementia began ( Ji et al., 2022 ). In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, metformin was associated with better cognitive performance, and CSF and imaging biomarkers in AD patients, if treatment started early ( Pomilio et al., 2022 ). In the same study population, non-demented metformin users had less atrophy in some brain regions ( Nabizadeh et al., 2022 ). A Swedish study found slower cognitive decline in people with AD who took metformin ( Secnik et al., 2021 ). A genetic analysis of variants in genes that affect blood sugar levels and metformin target genes linked several variants to a reduction in the risk of AD ( Zheng et al., 2022 ). This and other studies support the idea that metformin prevents cognitive aging by mechanisms other than glycemic control (e.g., see Charpignon et al., 2022 ; Zheng et al., 2023 ; Chen et al., 2023 ). In multiple preclinical models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, metformin was reported to improve behavioral phenotypes while decreasing Aβ pathology and tau phosphorylation (for a meta-analysis of animal results, see Craig et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2021 ; Lu et al., 2020 ; Zhao et al., 2023 ). Metformin was reported to normalize expression of some genes in the brain, induce the Aβ protease IDE, and activate chaperone-mediated autophagy of APP to reduce Aβ levels ( Qiu-Yue et al., 2022 ; Lu et al., 2020 ; Xu et al., 2021 ). Not all studies were positive: One found that metformin treatment in the P301S mouse tauopathy model reduced hyperphosphorylated tau but increased tau aggregation ( Barini et al., 2016 ). In a study of long-term treatment in 3XTG-AD mice, one year of metformin led to memory impairment, and increased Aβ plaques and tau pathology ( Cho et al., 2024 ). In people with Huntington's disease, metformin treatment was linked to better cognitive function and, in mouse models of HD, to longer survival and milder symptoms ( Hervás et al., 2017 ; Arnoux et al., 2018 ; Sanchis et al., 2019 ). Metformin was claimed to reduce production of toxic peptides from the C9orf72 expansion, and mitigate symptoms in a mouse model of ALS/FTD ( Zu et al., 2020 ). In C9orf72-expressing cells, metformin protected against mitochondria damage ( Feng et al., 2024 ).

Preclinically, minocycline prevented Aβ fibrillization and Aβ-induced microglial activation in vitro ( Familian et al. 2006 ). In mouse and rat models of AD, minocycline inhibition of microglial activation led to reduced amyloid and tau deposition, protection of hippocampal neurogenesis, and improved cognition ( Seabrook et al. 2006 ; Choi et al., 2007 ; Nobel et al., 2009 ; Biscaro et al., 2012 ).

Oligomerization and aggregation of α-synuclein is implicated in Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple-system atrophy. Minzasolmin was discovered at Neuropore, licensed to UCB in 2014, and licensed for co-development to Novartis in 2021. Neuropore scientists and collaborators have described a series of cyclic peptidomimetic compounds designed to interact with the C-terminal domain of α-synuclein and prevent it from binding to membranes and oligomerizing there. One compound was reported to reduce α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and in α-synuclein transgenic mouse models, where it also normalized neural and inflammatory markers, and ameliorated motor deficits. In vivo imaging showed a reduction in cortical synaptic α-synuclein within one hour of dosing in the mice ( Wrasidlo et al., 2016 ). Minzasolmin is a second-generation compound, optimized for oral bioavailability and brain entry. It is the purified R enantiomer of the racemic mixture NPT-200-11. In preclinical work, NPT-200-11 reduced retinal α-synuclein pathology over two months of daily administration in mice expressing human α-synuclein. It also lessened cortical α-synuclein pathology and astrogliosis, normalized striatal dopamine transporter levels, and improved motor function ( Price et al., 2018 ). Similar results were subsequently reported for minzasolmin ( Price et al., 2023 ). A high-resolution structure of oligomeric, membrane bound α-synuclein suggests that minzasolmin interacts with the protein to increase its flexibility and impair its embedding into the membrane. In this way, minzasolmin interferes with fibril growth and toxic pore formation, and promotes the release of synuclein monomers in their soluble, random coil form ( Schwarz et al., 2023 ).

The goal is to reduce expression of APP in the central nervous system and thus depress production of substrates for amyloid deposition, e.g. Aβ42 in AD and Aβ40 in CAA. Mivelsiran fuses a synthetic siRNA to a proprietary 2'-O-hexadecyl (C16) lipophilic conjugate, which was designed to enhance cellular penetration and distribution in the CNS. In published preclinical work, C16-siRNAs delivered by intrathecal or brain injection in mice spread broadly through the brain and targeted neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. The half-life of gene suppression was three to four months. In nonhuman primates, a single intrathecal injection of ALN-APP knocked down APP mRNA in the spinal cord and brain, and drove down CSF levels of the APP fragments sAPPα and sAPPβ by about 75 percent. The reductions persisted for two to three months, and gradually recovered to normal after about nine months. Intracerebroventricular injection in the CVN transgenic mouse model of brain and vascular amyloid deposition resulted in 50 percent reduction of APP mRNA and sAPPα, reduced Aβ40 deposition and inflammation, and normalization of brain glutamate levels and open-field behaviors ( Brown et al., 2022 ). According to a poster presentation at the July 2025 AAIC, an APP siRNA reduced amyloid pathology, disease biomarkers and behavioral deficits in young 5XFAD Alzheimer’s disease mice, modeling disease prevention.

It is being developed for the treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The decline of acetylcholine and cholinergic function in Alzheimer's disease contributes to cognitive symptoms. Widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors modestly improve function by boosting synaptic acetylcholine levels. An alternative strategy is to directly activate receptors with agonists. The rationale for targeting the α7-nicotinic receptor is that agonists will enhance cognition without causing side effects associated with over-activation of other acetylcholine receptors such as α4β2, or muscarinic receptors. Multiple α7 partial agonists and an allosteric modulator have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s and other indications (e.g., encenicline , RG3847 , nelonicline ). Merck is developing MK-1167 in collaboration with Neuphoria, which has published its work on selective, orally available α7-positive allosteric modulators ( Harvey et al., 2019 ).

Abnormal output from the striatum is implicated in positive schizophrenia symptoms of psychosis, hallucinations and delusions.

Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators released by white blood cells.,"Background Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used to treat asthma and allergy symptoms. Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators released by white blood cells. Specifically, montelukast inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT1 receptor. This blocks the action of leukotriene D4 on this receptor in the lungs and bronchi, reducing swelling of the airways. FDA-approved in 1998, the drug is available in generic form as a chewable tablet. It is widely used in the U.S. and other countries. Common side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Case reports have also associated montelukast with mental or mood changes that can be serious, including aggression, agitation, anxiety, depression, nightmares and even suicide, especially in adolescents. In 2009, the FDA added a neuropsychiatric adverse event warning to its label. Follow-up research continued the controversy ( Chen et al., 2014 ; Lu et al, 2015 ; Aldea Perona et al., 2016 ; Khalid et al., 2018 ). In 2020, the FDA updated the warning to include serious mental health side effects such as suicidal thoughts or actions, and restricted use to people who cannot tolerate other medicines. Montelukast has drawn interest as a means to target neuroinflammation. Neurons and microglia express leukotriene receptors, and leukotriene D4 is involved in inflammatory processes of aging, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and others (reviewed in Ghosh et al., 2016 ). Montelukast was reported to inhibit Aβ42 toxicity in cultured primary neurons, and reduced neurotoxicity and memory impairment in mice that received intracerebral Aβ infusions ( Lai et al., 2014 ; Lai et al., 2014 ). Six weeks of montelukast-fortified chow reportedly boosted neurogenesis, quieted microglia, restored blood-brain-barrier function in old rats and improved their memory to that of young rats ( Oct 2015 news on Marschallinger et al., 2015 ). In transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis, microglia were found to be the main source of leukotrienes in the brain ( Michael et al., 2020 ). In 5XFAD mice, montelukast modulated microglia phenotypes, reduced infiltration of T cells, and improved cognition ( Michael et al., 2021 ). Montelukast reduced brain inflammation in young, but not old, AD mice ( Wu et al., 2025 ). In a mouse model of dementia with Lewy bodies, it lessened α-synuclein load and restored memory ( Marschallinger et al., 2020 ). Montelukast was also reported to broadly reduce neuroinflammation in a rotenone rat model ( Mansour et al., 2018 ). In a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson’s disease mouse model, it reduced neurotoxicity, but did not improve motor functions ( Jang et al., 2017 ). An epidemiological study showed people who used montelukast for asthma to be slightly less likely to use dementia medicines in old age, live in nursing homes, or die compared to people on other asthma treatments ( Grinde and Engdahl, 2017 ). A registry study linked montelukast use to preservation of cognitive or neurological function as people aged ( Grinde et al., 2021 ), but another analysis found no relationship between montelukast use and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias ( Desai et al., 2025 ).

It is taken by mouth. p38α MAPK is expressed in microglia and neurons. In microglia, the enzyme stimulates release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β in response to a variety of stressors including Aβ42; in neurons, signaling via p38α MAPK has been implicated in tau localization and neuronal plasticity ( Yasuda et al., 2011 ; Bachstetter et al., 2011 ; Corrêa and Eales, 2012 ). In addition, p38α MAPK regulates Ras-related protein Rab5, a key regulator of early endosomes whose role in endolysosomal and synaptic vesicle function has made it a target in neurodegenerative disease drug development ( Germann and Alam, 2020 ). MW150 is one of a series of compounds co-developed by investigators at Northwestern University in Chicago and Columbia University in New York ( Jan 2002 news ; May 2017 conference news ; Jun 2018 conference news ). For MW150, a kinase inhibitor fragment was built out to achieve isoform specificity and brain penetration. In the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis, treatment from an early age prevented the development of memory deficits, without affecting amyloid plaque accumulation. In APP/PS knock-in mice, treatment of older mice suppressed memory deficits ( Roy et al., 2015 ; Roy et al., 2019 ). MW150 inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines from glia, and rescued synaptic dysfunction in the entorhinal cortex of these models ( Zhou et al., 2017 ; Rutigliano et al., 2018 ). In a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder, MW150 normalized poor social behaviors and physiological disturbances stemming from excess serotonin activity ( Robson et al., 2018 ).

MW151 was discovered by screening and optimizing compounds that inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production in activated glia cells in culture ( Wing et al., 2006 ). MW151 does not block anti-inflammatory cytokines. Neuroinflammation involving glial activation occurs in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, and contributes to disease pathology and cognitive decline. In preclinical work, MW151 suppressed microglia and astrocyte activation, and upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL1β, TNFα, and S100b after oligomeric human Aβ42 infusion into mouse brain. MW151 prevented loss of synaptic proteins and hippocampal-dependent behavioral deficits in the mice ( Hu et al., 2007 ). In an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model, MW151 treatment early in life reduced subsequent neuroinflammation, preventing losses of synapses and synaptic plasticity. The drug did not affect amyloid plaque load ( Bachstetter et al., 2012 ). MW151 also reduced acute inflammation after traumatic brain injury in the APP/PS1 mice, and improved cognitive outcomes, without lessening Aβ accumulation ( Webster et al., 2015 ). In a mouse model of mixed vascular and amyloid pathology, the compound reduced inflammation and improved markers of hippocampal metabolism; the mice were reported to have shown a trend toward improved memory functions ( Braun et al., 2022 ).

Nabilone is related to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, aka THC, the major psychoactive compound of cannabis. It is a partial agonist of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors found in the brain and in peripheral tissues. It is currently being tested to treat agitation in people with advanced AD dementia. Nabilone crosses the blood-brain barrier, and has central actions similar to THC's. In trials, the most frequent side effects were drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and euphoria. This drug has a high abuse potential. It causes mood and memory changes, and even psychosis, in some people (e.g. Udow et al., 2018 ). In a meta-analysis of clinical trials, nabilone was generally safe and well-tolerated in people over 50, but raised concerns because of increased alterations in thinking, as well as dizziness and lightheadedness ( Velayudhan et al., 2021 ; Velayudhan et al., 2021 ; commentary by Fick, 2021 ). For nausea associated with chemotherapy, the dose is 1 to 2 mg, taken in capsule form multiple times a day, up to a total of 6 mg. Because of its psychoactive effects and other adverse effects, it is a second-line treatment, used only when people do not respond to other anti-emetics. The primary interest in nabilone and other cannabinoids (see dronabinol , cannabidiol ) for Alzheimer's disease currently focuses on symptomatic treatment of agitation and aggression. Cannabinoids are mildly sedative and anxiolytic, and may act by reducing neuroinflammation, regulating neurotransmission, and improving sleep and circadian rhythms (reviewed in Outen et al., 2021 ). These compounds also increase appetite and decrease pain, which may benefit people with dementia. There is a large body of preclinical research on cannabinoids’ disease-modifying actions, in particular the role of CB2 receptors on microglia. In short, multiple receptor agonists have been shown to protect against Aβ-induced neural toxicity in AD animal models, by inhibiting inflammation, excitotoxity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tau hyperphosphorylation, and facilitating Aβ removal (reviewed by Cristino et al., 2020 ).","Overview Name: Nabilone Synonyms: Cesamet Chemical Name: (±)-trans-3-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)- 6,6a,7,8,10,10a-hexahydro-1-hydroxy-6-6-dimethyl-9H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-9-one Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other Neurotransmitters (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 3), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2) Company: Bausch Health Companies Inc.

In a new therapeutic approach, various forms of commercially available insulin are being atomized into a spray and inhaled through the nose. The rationale behind this exploration of insulin for the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia is twofold. First, brain areas affected in Alzheimer's disease have been shown to express insulin receptors, and insulin levels as well as insulin receptor signaling are thought to be reduced in Alzheimer's (e.g., Chiu et al., 2008 ; Steen et al., 2005 ). Second, if effective, delivery of this hormone directly into the brain along olfactory perivascular channels would sidestep the peripheral bloodstream. This would avoid the unwanted effect of increasing systemic insulin levels, which could lead to hypoglycemia or insulin resistance (e.g., Born et al., 2002 ). The physiological role of insulin in the brain is incompletely understood, but it has been implicated in synaptic remodeling and glucose utilization. Insulin has also been proposed to protect against Aβ toxicity, and insulin deficits have been linked to tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and other aspects of Alzheimer's pathophysiology ( De Felice et al., 2009 ; El Khoury et al., 2014 ; Zhao et al., 2009 ). Insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (see AlzRisk Diabetes , AlzRisk Obesity ). Intranasal insulin began attracting attention in Alzheimer's research when small human studies reported improved cognition without a change in blood glucose or insulin levels in healthy volunteers (e.g., May 2002 news ; Benedict et al., 2004 ; Benedict et al., 2007 ).","Overview Name: Nasal Insulin Synonyms: Detemir, Levemir, Humulin, Novolin, glulisine Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) , Other Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) , Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple System Atrophy U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2/3), Mild Cognitive Impairment (Phase 2), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 2), Multiple System Atrophy (Phase 2) Approved for: Diabetes",ongoing,2.0,False,,06 Jan 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/nasal-insulin

SARM1 activation is required for axon degeneration after nerve injury, and SARM1 inhibitors have the potential to prevent or slow neurodegenerative diseases that involve axon loss. Possible indications for NB-4746 include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. SARM1 was originally discovered as a suppressor of injury-induced axon death in Drosophila ( Osterloh et al., 2012 ). It was shown to trigger an active process of axon degeneration by depleting the energy and NAD+ ( Gerdts et al., 2015 ; Yang et al., 2015 ; Figley et al., 2021 ). Knockout of SARM1 improved nerve function after traumatic brain injury in mice ( Henninger et al., 2016 ), but did not protect dopamine terminals in an α-synuclein overexpression model of Parkinson’s disease ( Peters et al., 2021 ). SARM1 knockout accelerated progression in a mouse model of prion disease ( Zhu et al., 2019 ). Conflicting evidence exists for SARM1’s role in ALS. Variants in SARM1 affect a person’s risk of developing ALS ( van Rheenen et al., 2016 ; Bloom et al., 2022 ). Expression was found to be downregulated in neurons, muscle and blood from ALS patients ( Ma et al., 2024 ). In a C. elegans model of ALS, SARM1 was required for motor neuron degeneration ( Vérièpe et al., 2015 ). However, in an SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS , SARM1 knockout did not prevent loss of motor neurons ( Peters et al., 2018 ), but did stem an increase in serum neurofilament light ( Collins et al., 2022 ). Knockout protected axons in a model of TDP-43-linked motor neuron degeneration ( White et al., 2019 ). Loss of SARM1 prevented acceleration of disease progression in these ALS mice after nerve injury ( Dogan et al., 2025 ). In AD mice, SARM1 knockout delayed disease progression and reduced pathology ( Miao et al., 2024 ). Knockout also improved circadian rhythm disorder, decreased Aβ deposition, and rescued cognitive disorders in AD mice ( Wang et al., 2023 ). Nura Bio identified its proprietary SARM1 inhibitors by high-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry optimization. The inhibitors bind the SARM1 active site with low affinity, where they undergo conjugation to the enzyme reaction product to form a highly potent inhibitory adduct. The enzyme-adduct structure has been elucidated. In preclinical models, Nura Bio’s inhibitors reduced nerve fiber loss and plasma neurofilament light levels in models of nerve lesion or chemotherapy-induced toxicity ( Bratkowski et al., 2022 ). Early versions of SARM1 inhibitors protected mice against chemotherapy-induced neuropathy ( Bosanac et al., 2021 ), and in cell models of axotomy or toxin-induced nerve death ( Hughes et al., 2021 ).",Overview Name: NB-4746 Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis U.S. FDA Status: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Phase 1) Company: Nura Bio™ Inc.,ongoing,1.0,False,,07 Mar 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/nb-4746

Previously called VX-745, neflamapimod has been repurposed for evaluation in neurodegenerative diseases. VX-745 was discovered at Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It was being tested for rheumatoid arthritis, but was later discontinued, in part due to adverse effects in the central nervous system in preclinical studies ( Haddad, 2001 ). This drug has been reported to reach higher concentrations in the CNS than peripheral blood. p38 MAPKα is expressed in microglia and neurons. In microglia, the enzyme stimulates release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β in response to a variety of stressors including Aβ42; in neurons, signaling via p38 MAPKα has been implicated in tau localization and neuronal plasticity ( Yasuda et al., 2011 ; Bachstetter et al., 2011 ; Corrêa and Eales, 2012 ). In addition, p38 MAPKα regulates Ras-related protein Rab5, a key regulator of early endosomes whose role in endolysosomal and synaptic vesicle function has made it a target in neurodegenerative disease drug development ( Germann and Alam, 2020 ). Other p38 MAPKα inhibitors are reported to slow progression in AD mouse models ( Roy et al., 2015 ). In animal models, VX-745 reportedly shifts microglial activation from a pro-inflammatory to a phagocytic state, improving mitochondrial function, synaptic transmission, and memory. In 2-year-old Tg2576 mice treated with 3 mg/kg for two weeks, amyloid plaque load was halved. In aged rats, which develop more neuroinflammation than Tg2576 mice, VX-745 lowered IL-1β, increased the postsynaptic marker PSD95, and improved performance in the Morris water maze, though these effects were apparent at different doses ( Dec 2014 conference news ; Alam, 2015 ). In a rat ischemic stroke model, subacute treatment for six weeks dose-dependently promoted behavior, sensory and motor function recovery, and raised brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels ( Alam et al., 2020 ). This drug also induces blood vessel dilation, and inhibits vascular inflammation in rats ( Pandey et al., 2022 ; Menon et al., 2023 ). Recently, neflamapimod was reported to improve cholinergic dysfunction by inhibiting p38MAPK-driven Rab5 activity in neurons. In a mouse model of Rab5-dependent lysosomal pathology with cholinergic degeneration, neflamapimod reduced Rab5 activation, normalized the function of Rab5+ lysosomes, prevented degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and improved behavior in novel object recognition and open field tests ( Jiang et al., 2022 ). Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are the main source of acetylcholine in the brain, and in people, their loss leads to cognitive decline and movement problems.

It is being developed to treat Parkinson’s disease.,"Background NEU-411 is a small molecule that enters the brain and inhibits the leucine-rich repeat kinase LRRK2. It is being developed to treat Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2, also known as Dardarin, is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity. Kinase-activating LRRK2 mutations cause a rare, inherited form Parkinson’s disease, and more common variants in the gene are associated with a higher risk of PD. Increased LRRK2 kinase activity impairs vesicle trafficking and lysosome function, and promotes neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to PD pathology (e.g., Taylor and Alessi, 2020 ; Shutinoski et al., 2019 ; Sep 2018 news ). For these reasons, LRRK2 has been aggressively pursued as a drug target, and many inhibitors have been synthesized (for reviews, see Dang et al., 2025 ; Taymans et al., 2023 ). Little information has been disclosed about NEU-411, and no preclinical research is published. Studies using other inhibitors or genetic knockdown in rodent models of PD have reported reduction of α-synuclein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuron loss ( Daher et al., 2014 ; Daher et al., 2015 ; Ho et al., 2022 ; Ho et al., 2022 ). In a mouse model of LRRK2 mutation-associated PD, three months of inhibitor treatment restored neuroprotective functions to striatal neurons and astrocytes ( Jaimon et al., 2025 ). Inhibitors also promoted physiological tetramerization and synaptic localization of α-synuclein ( Fonseca-Ornales et al., 2022 ; Brzozowski et al., 2021 ). In animal and cell models of Aβ42 toxicity, other LRRK2 inhibitors attenuated neuroinflammation ( Mutti et al., 2023 ; Filippini et al., 2023 ). Kinase inhibitors may have unacceptable side effects, as they have been reported to cause changes in lung cell morphology in rodents and nonhuman primates (e.g. Baptista et al., 2020 ; Bryce et al., 2021 ). Neuron23’s development strategy is to identify the subset of patients most likely to respond to LRRK2 inhibitors. Thus, they are limiting clinical trial participation to people with rare LRRK2 mutations, or with common gene variants thought to increase LRRK2 pathway activity. The company claims this amounts to 30 percent of PD patients. In 2023, the company began Phase 1 with a different LRRK2 inhibitor, NEU-723.

It combines brief trains of 10 Hz electric pulses to brain regions affected in AD, i.e., frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, alternating with sessions of computerized cognitive training designed to engage those same regions. Pulses are delivered by a figure-eight-shaped magnetic coil placed outside the head, near the scalp. Six brain regions are stimulated separately. A course of treatment consists of two or more weeks of daily sessions. High frequency TMS (10 Hz or greater) increases cortical excitability, induces LTP-like changes in synaptic strength, and increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. The end effects vary based on the frequency and intensity of the pulses, and the brain areas targeted. NeuroAD is one of several rTMS protocols that have been evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease. Multiple meta-analyses indicate that, overall, this form of neuromodulation can improve cognitive function in people with mild to moderate AD, although trials have not shown a consistent benefit from concurrent cognitive training (e.g., see Menardi et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Lin et al., 2019 ). One study suggests that rTMS is less effective in ApoE4 carriers than noncarriers ( Wei and Chen, 2021 ). rTMS targeted to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is approved for the treatment of refractory depression worldwide. In Europe, rTMS is approved for treatment of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other conditions. rTMS is considered safe, with minor side effects including headache, scalp discomfort at the stimulation site, tingling, spasms or twitching of facial muscles, toothache, neck pain, and lightheadedness.","Overview Name: NeuroAD Synonyms: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation , rTMS-Cog Therapy Type: Procedural Intervention Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Rejected) Company: Neuronix Ltd",unknown,,False,,02 Mar 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/neuroad

Nilotinib induces autophagy, leading to death of rapidly dividing cells ( Salomoni and Calabretta, 2009 ).","Background Nilotinib is an oral Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib induces autophagy, leading to death of rapidly dividing cells ( Salomoni and Calabretta, 2009 ). The drug carries a black-box warning of sudden death due to cardiac arrythmia. It also can cause myelosuppression. Nilotinib (and another Abl kinase inhibitor cancer drug, bosutinib ) has been proposed for repurposing as a disease-modifying treatment for synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Abl kinase phosphorylates α-synuclein and prevents its degradation. By inhibiting Abl, nilotinib promotes α-synuclein clearance by autophagy ( Mahul-Mellier et al., 2014 ). Nilotinib has also been reported to increase toxicity of α-synuclein in Neuro2A cells ( Shaker et al, 2013 ) and to induce apoptosis and autophagic cell death in cultured liver cells ( Eteläinen et al., 2022 ). Additional targets of nilotinib are the discoidin domain receptor (DDR) tyrosine kinases, which have been implicated in cancer, fibrotic disorders, and inflammatory diseases. DDR1 is claimed to be elevated in AD brain. In models of protein toxicity, DDR1 or DDR2 knockdown reduced levels of α-synuclein, tau, and Aβ, and inflammation ( Hebron et al., 2017 ). Inhibition of DDR2 may account for some aspects of nilotinib’s cardiac toxicity ( Carracedo et al., 2022 ). Nilotinib has been tested in preclinical models of PD and DLB. In the MPTP toxicity model of parkinsonism, nilotinib prevented dopaminergic cell death and behavioral deficits ( Karuppagounder et al., 2014 ). In α-synuclein-overexpressing mice, nilotinib lowered levels of α-synuclein and phosphorylated tau in brain. Treatment was reported to increase brain dopamine and improved animals’ motor skills and cognition ( Hebron et al., 2013 ; Hebron et al., 2013 ; Hebron et al., 2014 ). In other models, nilotinib was reported to improve tau clearance and astrocytic function in tau P301L mice and to promote amyloid clearance in TgAPP mice ( Hebron et al., 2018 ; Lonskaya et al., 2013 ). In addition, it reportedly protected against TDP-43 toxicity in mice ( Heyburn et al., 2016 ; Wenqiang et al., 2014 ). Much of this preclinical work came from one group at Georgetown University. In independent studies, nilotinib failed to lessen synuclein accumulation and cell death in mice expressing mutated α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes to model multiple systems atrophy ( Lopez-Cuina et al., 2020 ). In a different proteinopathy model, nilotinib did not improve autophagy, pathology, survival, or motor behaviors in mice expressing mutated Huntingtin protein ( Kumar et al., 2021 ). The drug did inhibit microglia-mediated dopaminergic death induced by LPS injection in an inflammatory model of PD ( Wu et al., 2021 ). In AD models, nilotinib prevented degeneration of dopamine neurons and improved memory performance in Tg2576 mice ( La Barbera et al., 2021 ; see also Nobili et al., 2021 ).

It has been prescribed in Europe and Japan to treat hypertension since the 1990s and has accumulated a strong safety record. Nilvadipine is manufactured by Astellas Pharma US and sold as 8 mg prolonged-release capsules. After its patent expired, Archer Pharmaceuticals obtained intellectual property rights to develop it for Alzheimer's. There is growing epidemiological evidence that chronic high blood pressure increases risk for dementia ( AlzRisk database ). Some studies have suggested promise for treatment with anti-hypertensive medications, but the evidence is mixed. It remains unclear which class of anti-hypertensive—e.g., calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, drugs targeting angiotensin, or diuretics—are most beneficial for symptomatic versus prophylactic treatment ( Mar 2006 news story ). Mid-life hypertension is widely viewed as causing neurovascular damage that impairs neurovascular homeostasis in late life, hence drugs that lower blood pressure may be counterindicated in aged people who have neurovascular disease or orthostatic hypotension ( May 2014 news story ; Dec 2013 Webinar ). One small Japanese study reported that nilvadipine prevented cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment, and there are case reports of nilvadipine increasing cerebral blood flow in patients with early Alzheimer's and hypertension ( Hanyu et al., 2007 ; Matsuda et al., 2008 ; Sato et al., 2008 ). An in vitro study reported that nilvadipine reduces Aβ accumulation, albeit at much higher doses than its reported effects on L-type calcium channels (see Jul 2011 news story ; Paris et al., 2011 ; Cho et al., 1989 ).

The V1aR is expressed in multiple areas of the brain, and plays a role in social behaviors, anxiety, and threat processing. Nonselective vasopressin receptor antagonists are marketed as diuretics that act on V1 and V2 receptors in the kidney to increase urine production. They are mainly prescribed to correct low blood sodium, particularly in people with congestive heart failure. Several lines of evidence argue for using selective V1aR antagonists to treat Alzheimer’s agitation. Concentrations of vasopressin in cerebrospinal fluid positively correlated with levels of aggression in people with personality disorders ( Coccaro et al., 1998 ). In healthy adults, the V1aR antagonist SRX246 suppressed anxiety induced by unpredictable electric shocks ( Lago et al., 2021 ). It also reduced aggressive behavior in people with Huntington disease and irritability ( Maibach et al., 2022 ). However, people with Alzheimer’s disease are reported to have deficits of vasopressin in CSF and brain tissue ( Raskind, et al., 1986 ; Mazurek et al., 1986 ).

Inflammasomes are multiprotein, cytosolic complexes that function as sensors in the innate immune system. They are found in microglia in the brain, and in monocytes and macrophages outside the brain. Their activation by pathologic proteins and other stressors triggers production and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL1-β and IL-18. Inflammasomes can induce cell death. NLRP3-containing inflammasome activation is implicated in a growing number of neurodegenerative conditions where chronic inflammation plays a role, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as in obesity and cardiovascular disease (reviewed in Li et al., 2023 ). In Alzheimer’s mouse models, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to reduce amyloid and tau pathology ( Heneka et al., 2013 ; Ising et al., 2020 ). NT-0796 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cytokine production in human blood with an IC50 of 6.8 nanomolar ( Harrison et al., 2023 ).

In April 2016, the FDA approved this once-daily atypical antipsychotic to treat the delusions and hallucinations that are a feature of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, and it came on the market in the U.S. in June ( Apr 2016 news ; prescribing information ). Pimavanserin is thought to have fewer adverse effects than older antipsychotic agents used to treat Parkinson's psychosis, but evidence remains limited (e.g., Sarva and Henchcliffe, 2016 ; Tampi et al., 2019 ). The drug carries a black-box warning of increased mortality in elderly people. One large retrospective study reported a higher risk of death in nursing home residents with PD who were prescribed pimavanserin ( Hwang et al., 2021 ), while other analyses found no extra risk ( Moreno et al., 2018 ; FDA analysis ). Debate continues regarding these results, and regarding the safety of pimavanserin in real-world use (e.g., see Ganesh and Galetta, 2022 ; Subbiah et al., 2022 ; Hwang et al., 2022 ). A meta-analysis of clinical trials involving 680 patients found significant reduction in hallucinations and delusions, with no change in other symptoms. Adverse events were similar to placebo, except that the pimavanserin group had less orthostatic hypotension ( Mansuri et al., 2022 ). In a small retrospective study of 54 patients, half of patients showed initial improvement in psychosis, but only 15 percent maintained the benefit after a year of treatment ( Akbar and Friedman, 2022 ). An analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with PD who were starting pimavanserin or an atypical antipsychotic indicated lower mortality with pimavanserin, but only during the first 180 days of treatment and only in community-dwelling, not nursing home, patients ( Mosholder et al., 2022 ). Two Acadia-funded studies reported similar reduced mortality for pimavanserin compared to other antipsychotics in the first 180 days and one year, whether patients were at home or in a facility ( Layton et al., 2023 ; Rao et al., 2025 ). A meta-analysis of real-world evidence reported that pimavanserin did not increase the mortality risk in PD psychosis, and performed similarly to other atypical psychotics used in this indication ( Isaacson et al., 2024 ). Pimavanserin affects heart rhythms and should not be used by people with arrhythmia or those who take drugs that prolong the QT interval. The most common adverse events seen in trials were peripheral edema, nausea, confusion, hallucinations, constipation, and gait disturbance, though Acadia argues that PD with psychoses itself is associated with a higher risk of falls ( Forns et al., 2021 ). In post-marketing reports from the FDA adverse event database, hallucinations and death were most frequently mentioned, while newly identified side effects included sleep disorders and cognitive and behavior changes ( Gu et al., 2024 ). An Acadia-funded analysis of Medicare records claimed that Parkinson’s patients in nursing homes who took pimavanserin had a lower risk of falls and bone fractures, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits, compared to those on other anti-psychotics ( Rajagopalan et al., 2024 ; Rajagopalan et al., 2024 ). Analysis of a smaller number of Medicare beneficiaries found a lower risk of hospitalization, but similar mortality rates for pimavanserin users compared to quetiapine ( Alipour-Haris et al., 2023 ). Phase 4/real-world trials in Parkinson's psychosis are ongoing ( Dashtipour et al., 2021 ; Cusick and Gupta, 2021 ). A systematic literature review and survey of practitioners in Germany and Austria favored clozapine for its efficacy and tolerability in treating Parkinson’s disease psychosis, with pimavanserin as an alternative ( Rose et al., 2024 ). Data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System revealed a trend toward increased rate of reported adverse events with time since approval, with most accruing in the first month of treatment. Newly identified adverse events not listed on the label include orthostatic hypotension, hypersexuality, excess salivation, and hyperactivity. Some adverse events varied in incidence between men and women, and may have been related to disease processes rather than pimavanserin itself ( Liu et al., 2025 ). Pimavanserin and quetiapine have been reported to improve misidentification delusions such as Capgras syndrome in PD and Lewy body dementia patients ( Hermanowicz et al., 2018 ; reviewed in Luca et al., 2025 ). In efforts to expand the indications for Nuplazid, Acadia initiated trials for psychosis, agitation, and aggression in Alzheimer's disease, for psychosis related to all-cause dementia, and for schizophrenia, insomnia, PTSD, depression, and autism. A different serotonin 2A receptor inverse agonist, nelotanserin , was in Phase 2 development for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but has been discontinued. Serotonin receptor activation is known to inhibit brain Aβ peptide production by altering the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein ( Sheline et al., 2014 ). In recent preclinical work, pimavanserin or another 5HT2A agonist, M100907, acutely reduced Aβ concentrations in brain interstitial fluid of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Chronic administration to aged APP/PS1 mice decreased CSF Aβ and brain plaque pathology, and improved cognition ( Yuede et al., 2021 ; Gründer and Cumming, 2021 ).

Its target, a nematode-specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit, is not present in humans. NUZ-001 does, however, inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and induces autophagy. Through this mechanism, it is claimed to decrease TDP-43 protein aggregation, a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Nuz-001 was discovered to inhibit mTOR signaling in cancer cells ( Bahrami et al., 2014 ; Bahrami et al., 2014 ).

It is delivered by intravenous injection. This peptide was designed from the most conserved sequence of the thrombospondin repeats from the SCO-spondin protein. SCO-spondin, a large, multifunctional glycoprotein specific to the CNS extracellular matrix, is produced by the subcommissural organ during embryogenesis, and is essential for neural development. SCO-spondin has also been proposed to function in adult neurogenesis ( Inada et al., 2023 ). Both linear and cyclic forms of this peptide have been evaluated preclinically. The linear NX210 is converted in vivo to NX210c by formation of an intrachain disulfide bridge between two cysteines. In a mouse amyloidosis model, NX210 and NX210c reduced pathologic markers of Aβ42, p-Tau, and inflammation, after intraventricular injection of Aβ oligomers ( Le Douce et al., 2021 ). In this study, conducted by Axoltis researchers, the peptides improved behaviors related to cognition and memory in the Y maze, passive avoidance test, and Morris water maze. In other Axoltis-sponsored preclinical work, NX210 protected against oxidative stress and stimulated axonal regrowth and functional recovery in a spinal cord injury model ( Sakka et al., 2014 ). NX201 and NX201c both protected neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity by disrupting the apoptotic signaling cascade; NX210c was more effective ( Deletage et al., 2021 ).

CETP inhibitors block the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) into other lipoproteins; in this way they promote removal of cholesterol by HDL.,"Background This cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor is being developed primarily as a cholesterol-targeted therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease. CETP inhibitors block the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) into other lipoproteins; in this way they promote removal of cholesterol by HDL. Drugs of this class were initially developed to increase “good” HDL cholesterol, and were shown to also reduce “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in people. Previous CETP inhibitors evacetrapib and dalcetrapib were discontinued when they showed no improvement in cardiovascular outcomes despite raising HDL (see review by Nurmohamed et al., 2022 ; also Oct 2021 news ). The first CETP inhibitor torcetrapib increased adverse cardiovascular events because of off-target toxicity. Anacetrapib did lower event rates, albeit modestly, and this was related to lowering of non-HDL cholesterol. Obicetrapib is more potent than previous inhibitors, such that a dose of 10 mg once daily reduces CETP activity by 97 percent. It has no reported off-targets effects, and is safe in Phase III clinical development (see review by Chang et al., 2024 ). The rationale for testing this CETP inhibitor for Alzheimer’s disease stems from work linking high levels of HDL to longer life and preserved cognition ( Barzilai et al., 2006 ; Lewis et al., 2010 ). By its ability to elevate HDL particles, ApoA1, and ApoE, obicetrapib increases cholesterol efflux from cells, a process which may mitigate the risk of AD due to ApoE4, and help clear Aβ from brain ( van Capelleveen et al., 2016 ; Van Valkenburgh et al., 2021 ). Although early studies suggested that low-activity CETP gene variants that mimic inhibition do not decrease the risk of AD ( Nordestgaard et al., 2022 ; Peloso et al., 2018 ), recent Mendelian randomization studies in very large cohorts show unequivocally that genetically determined lower CETP activity is associated with higher total brain volume and decreased risk of multiple forms of dementia ( Schmidt et al., 2024 ). These MR data are supported by studies showing loss-of-function mutations in the CETP gene found in long-lived people protect against Alzheimer’s, particularly in apoE4 carriers ( Barzilai et al., 2006 ; Sanders et al., 2010 ).

Much of the publicly available information on this compound comes from meeting presentations. A high-throughput screen for tau self-association, using full-length, non-mutated tau under what were characterized as physiologically relevant pH and protein concentrations, identified several classes of small-molecule leads. Hits were refined for activity in cell-based assays of tau aggregation, and brain penetration (e.g., see AAIC abstracts Moe et al. 2016 , Moe et al., 2017 ). A published report of preclinical work details the results of feeding OLX-07010 for four months at daily doses of 10, 40 or 100 mg/kg to human tau-expressing htau mice, starting before tau pathology appeared in brain. The middle dose produced the highest brain levels of compound, and reduced soluble tau oligomers, as well as insoluble and phosphorylated tau in brain, compared to untreated mice ( Davidowitz et al., 2020 ). Positive effects on tau and motor behaviors in the JNPL3 tau mutant mice were reported at meetings (e.g. Moe et al., 2021 AAIC ).

LRRK2, also known as Dardarin, is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity.","Background This small molecule, brain-penetrant inhibitor of the leucine-rich repeat kinase LRRK2 is being developed as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2, also known as Dardarin, is a large, multidomain protein containing serine and threonine kinase activity. Kinase-activating LRRK2 mutations cause a rare, inherited form of Parkinson’s disease, and more common variants in the gene are associated with a higher risk of PD. Increased LRRK2 kinase activity impairs vesicle trafficking and lysosome function, and promotes neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to PD pathology (e.g., Taylor and Alessi, 2020 ; Shutinoski et al., 2019 ; Sep 2018 news ). For these reasons, LRRK2 has been aggressively pursued as a drug target, and many inhibitors have been synthesized (for reviews, see Dang et al., 2025 ; Taymans et al., 2023 ). OPM-201 was discovered at Oncodesign Precision Medicine, using a proprietary medicinal chemistry technology to produce potent and selective kinase inhibitors with cyclic structures. These inhibitors have a lower molecular weight than conventional linear structures, and are claimed to be more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier ( Ma et al., 2022 ). Information on the company website describes a macrocyclic compound that inhibits LRRK2 in cells with an IC50 of less than 1 nM, with equal potency for wild-type or mutated LRRK2. The compound showed above 100-fold selectivity for LRRK2 over other kinases ( poster 1 ). Peripheral administration reduced LRRK2 activity in rat or mouse brain. In nonhuman primates, the compound entered the brain. It inhibited LRRK2 with similar potency in blood and brain ( poster 2 ). No preclinical studies have been reported using OPM-101 in PD animal models. In target validation studies, other inhibitors or genetic knockdown were shown to reduce α-synuclein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuron loss ( Daher et al., 2014 ; Daher et al., 2015 ; Ho et al., 2022 ; Ho et al., 2022 ). In a mouse model of LRRK2 mutation-associated PD, three months of inhibitor treatment restored neuroprotective functions to striatal neurons and astrocytes ( Jaimon et al., 2025 ). Inhibitors also promoted physiological tetramerization and synaptic localization of α-synuclein ( Fonseca-Ornales et al., 2022 ; Brzozowski et al., 2021 ). In animal and cell models of Aβ42 toxicity, other LRRK2 inhibitors attenuated neuroinflammation ( Mutti et al., 2023 ; Filippini et al., 2023 ). Kinase inhibitors may have unacceptable side effects, as they have been reported to cause changes in lung cell morphology in rodents and nonhuman primates (e.g., Baptista et al., 2020 ; Bryce et al., 2021 ).

Progranulin insufficiency interferes with proper lysosomal function. PBFT02 is intended to overcome progranulin deficiency in mutation carriers. PBFT02 is delivered as a one-time injection into the cerebrospinal fluid in the cisterna magna at the base of the brain. In preclinical work, intraventricular injection of AAV-GRN into progranulin-deficient mice led to elevated progranulin concentration in the brain and CSF, normalization of lysosome function, and reduction in microgliosis. In nonhuman primates, a single injection into the cisterna magna raised CSF progranulin to 40 times normal human levels, with no apparent toxic effects ( Hinderer et al., 2020 ).",Overview Name: PBFT02 Therapy Type: DNA/RNA-based Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Frontotemporal Dementia U.S. FDA Status: Frontotemporal Dementia (Phase 1/2) Company: Passage Bio,ongoing,1.0,False,,03 Jul 2024,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/pbft02

It is an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative that disrupts the interaction between metals and the Aβ peptide in the brain. The rationale is that as an MPAC, PBT2 prevents Aβ accumulation while also restoring copper and zinc ion homoeostasis in cells. According to scientists at Alterity Therapeutics, formerly Prana Biotechnology Ltd., increasing bioactive metal levels in the aging brain accelerates formation of amyloid plaques as well as neurotoxic oxidative processes. PBT2 translocates copper and zinc ions into the cell, reducing their extracellular levels and thereby reducing metal-mediated Aβ aggregation. It does so by acting as a copper and zinc ionophore rather than a chelator. PBT2 was reported to improve indicators of synaptic health such as spine density and synaptic protein levels in APP transgenic mice ( Bush and Tanzi, 2008 ; Crouch et al., 2011 ; Adlard et al., 2011 ). Two studies reported that copper drives aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein and that PBT2 improved motor performance and extended the lifespan in a mouse model of HD (see Fox et al., 2007 ; Cherny et al., 2012 ).

In response to stress or injury, neurons release soluble Sema4D, which binds to receptors on glia and activates inflammatory cytokine release. Sema4D inhibits axon extension and oligodendrocyte migration, and disrupts the blood-brain barrier ( Smith et al., 2015 ). Pepinemab neutralizes Sema4D to prevent these actions ( Fisher et al., 2016 ). Semaphorins, a large family of signaling proteins, were first described in the nervous system. Sema4D, aka CD100, is expressed on macrophages and involved in monocyte migration, T cell activation, atherosclerosis, and other conditions (e.g. Hall et al., 1996 ; Elhabazi et al., 2003 , Luque et al., 2018 ).

Low-energy lasers or light-emitting diodes are placed on or near the skin.,"Background Photobiomodulation is a form of light therapy that exposes tissue to red or near-infrared (NIR) light. Low-energy lasers or light-emitting diodes are placed on or near the skin. Their light penetrates tissue, where endogenous chromophores absorb it, and cause physical and chemical changes in cells. This non-heating therapy employs wavelengths from ~600 to ~1100 nm. Near-infrared light, with its longer wavelengths, penetrates tissues more deeply than shorter wavelengths of red light. This treatment causes no notable side effects, and can be done at home. Red or NIR light is claimed to promote cell health by enhancing mitochondrial energy production, and by increasing blood circulation. Absorption of NIR light by the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome C oxidase and subsequent stimulation of the respiratory chain is the commonly claimed mechanism of action (reviewed in Hamblin, 2018 ). This therapy has been studied in animal models, where it is reported to increase ATP production, stimulate anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant responses, promote neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and improve cognition (reviewed in Salehpour et al., 2018 ). In healthy rats, photobiomodulation (PBM) improved the metabolic profile, spatial memory, and neuroinflammation markers in young and aged animals ( Dos Santos Cardoso et al., 2021 ; Cardoso et al., 2022 ). Literature in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease reports improved mitochondrial function, reduced Aβ plaques, tau tangles, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and lessening of cognitive deficits after transcranial PBM (e.g. De Taboada et al., 2011 ; reviewed in Su et al., 2023 ; Salehpour et al., 2021 ). Targeting abdomen, bone marrow, or lymph nodes with light therapy also improved outcomes in mouse models of AD and PD ( Oron and Oron, 2016 ; Johnstone et al., 2014 ; Wu et al., 2022 ; Farfara et al., 2015 ). PBM is claimed to activate microglia, stimulate glymphatic clearance of Aβ, and improve gut flora ( Salehpour et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2021 ; Liebert et al., 2019 ; Stepanov et al., 2022 ). In a negative study, transcranial PBM with 810 nm light had no benefit in the 5XFAD mouse model ( Sipion et al., 2023 ). For a recent review on preclinical and clinical development of PBM for AD and PD, see Shen et al., 2024 . Parameters of time, wavelength, power, and light source for PBM are under investigation (e.g. Spera et al. 2021 ; Joshi et al., 2024 ). In extracranial low-energy applications, only a tiny fraction of light penetrates the skull to reach the brain, although applying higher light intensity can increase penetration ( Henderson and Morries, 2015 ). Human cadaver studies have shown near-infrared wavelengths can penetrate 40 mm through the scalp and skull into the brain ( Tedford et al., 2015 ). Alternative approaches such as intracranial and intranasal delivery are being investigated to reach deeper brain structures (e.g., Salehpour et al., 2020 ). Many different PBM devices are sold directly to consumers for home use. Some are FDA-approved for treating pain and inflammation, wound healing, promoting hair growth, and decreasing fat deposits; many are not.

Takeda developed pioglitazone as a once-daily treatment of type 2 diabetes. The FDA approved it in 1999 as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the control of blood sugar in adults with this disease. Since then pioglitazone has come to be prescribed worldwide, but was withdrawn from the market in Germany and France because of concerns that it might increase the risk of bladder cancer. The issue remains under review in the United States, though in its update issued in August 2013, the FDA did not conclude that pioglitazone increased the risk of bladder cancer. Generic tablet versions became available starting in 2012. In recent years, PPARγ has come to be a target of interest for Alzheimer's drug development, both because of a general overlap of metabolic disease and Alzheimer's disease risk factors and because cell-based and animal studies have implicated PPARγ, in particular, to play a role in neuroinflammatory processes in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative conditions. For example, PPARγ activation has been shown to modulate the microglial response to amyloid deposition in such a way that it increases Aβ phagocytosis and decreases cytokine release ( Dec 2012 news story ; Yamanaka et al., 2012 ; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2012 ).","Overview Name: Pioglitazone Synonyms: AD4833, Actos®, Glustin™, Piozone® Chemical Name: 2,4-Thiazolidinedione Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Inflammation (timeline) , Other (timeline) Condition(s): Mild Cognitive Impairment U.S. FDA Status: Mild Cognitive Impairment (Phase 3) Company: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Zinfandel Pharmaceuticals Inc.

It was raised against a constrained cyclic peptide derived from amino acids 13–16 (HHQK) of Aβ. This epitope was predicted by computer modeling to be exposed on toxic Aβ oligomers but not monomers or fibrils. The peptide was reported to accelerate Aβ aggregation in vitro, suggesting this epitope plays a role in seeding the formation of Aβ oligomers, and thus is a good target for inhibition by an antibody ( Cashman et al., 2021, AAIC poster ). In preclinical work, PMN310 selectively bound to Aβ oligomers over monomers. It inhibited Aβ oligomer propagation and toxicity in vitro and in cell assays. It prevented Aβ-induced memory deficits, and lessened synaptic loss and inflammation caused by cerebroventricular Aβ-oligomer injection in mice ( Kaplan et al., 2023 ; US Patent 9.216,217 B2 ). The antibody did not bind to Aβ plaque or vascular deposits in AD brain tissue sections, but did react with soluble oligomer-enriched fractions ( Gibbs et al., 2019 ). In a direct comparison with other Aβ antibodies, PMN310 was the least affected by high concentrations of competing monomeric Aβ, a characteristic that correlates with clinical efficacy of trialed antibodies ( Kaplan et al., 2023 AD/PD poster ; Kaplan et al., 2024 preprint ). The ability of PMN310 to target oligomers in the presence of competing monomers and plaque suggests a potential for better target engagement in brain and a lower risk of ARIA, compared to other, less-selective antibodies.","Overview Name: PMN310 Therapy Type: Immunotherapy (passive) (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1) Company: ProMIS Neurosciences, Inc.",ongoing,1.0,False,,24 Jan 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/pmn310

These receptors are expressed throughout the brain on vascular smooth muscle cells, where they mediate the vasoconstrictive effect of norepinephrine/adrenaline. Prazosin went off patent in 2013 and is available as a generic. Prazosin's side effects include weakness, fatigue, headache, and nausea, among others, but it is generally well-tolerated and not sedating. Besides hypertension, it is being prescribed for other indications, such as benign hypertrophy of the prostate and post-traumatic stress disorder. Prazosin may be considered to treat agitation in people with Alzheimer’s disease when other medication classes are ineffective or not tolerated ( Tampi et al., 2022 ). Prazosin started drawing interest in Alzheimer's disease research in the early 2000s as a potential alternative to antipsychotic medications for the treatment of aggressive agitation in the moderate stages of the disease. Aggression in AD is distressing to caregivers and frequently precipitates placement in a nursing home. Pathology studies showed that in AD, α-1 adrenergic receptors undergo region-specific changes, and that degeneration of adrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus is accompanied by compensatory increases in both norepinephrine and the postsynaptic α-1 receptor (e.g. Shimohama et al., 1986 ; Szot et al., 2006 ). Prazosin has been reported to reduce Aβ generation in neuronal cultures, and to improve behavioral and inflammatory outcome measures in APP23 mice ( Katsouri et al., 2013 ). Growing interest in the connection between hypertension, neurovascular function, and Alzheimer's disease has led to the concept of increased postsynaptic responsiveness to adrenaline, perhaps aided by Aβ.

PRI-002 comprises D-amino acids, the optical isomers of natural L forms. D-peptides are favored for protein drugs, because they can be taken by mouth, resist protease degradation in the stomach and metabolic degradation, and are less immunogenic than natural peptides. They cross the blood-brain barrier. PRI-002 was identified by Dieter Willbold's lab in Düsseldorf, using mirror image phage display to select all-D peptides that bind Aβ42 ( Wiesehan et al., 2003 ). The original hits were optimized for their ability to slow fibril formation and destabilize toxic oligomers ( Aug 2009 conference news ; Brener et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). PRI-002 (also called RD2) was capable of disaggregating Aβ oligomers extracted from brain tissue of people who had Alzheimer’s disease ( May 2022 news ). The lab has published preclinical studies on PRI-002. In mice, the peptide, when given orally, reaches nearly the same concentrations in brain as in blood ( Leithold et al., 2016 ). The peptide appeared effective in three mouse models of Alzheimer’s. In APPSL mice, it improved performance in the Morris water maze after six weeks of treatment ( Kutzsche et al., 2017 ). It similarly enhanced cognition in young or old APP/PS1 mice ( van Groen et al., 2017 ; Schemmert et al., 2018 ). In the TBA2.1 mouse model of pyroglutamate-Aβ-induced motor neuron neurodegeneration, mice who ate PRI-002 jelly for 12 weeks showed partial improvement of their motor deficit ( Schemmert et al., 2019 ). At the 2020 CTAD conference, Willbold presented data on aging beagles, a model of spontaneous AD. Dogs that were older than 10, and cognitively impaired, were fed 3 or 30 mg/kg PRI-002 or placebo daily for three months. Treated dogs reportedly improved their accuracy on a test of short-term memory compared to placebo, and the memory benefit of the higher dose was retained during a two-month post-treatment washout. In the subsequent publication of this work, the investigators also reported a decrease in CSF tau oligomers after treatment at the higher dose ( Kutzsche et al., 2023 ). Aβ oligomers were unchanged. An 18F-labeled analog of PRI-002 was investigated as a potential PET probe for soluble Aβ oligomers, but it failed to discriminate between wild-type and APP/PS1 mice with amyloidosis ( Willuweit et al., 2023 ).","Overview Name: PRI-002 Synonyms: Contraloid, contraloid acetate, RD2 Chemical Name: all D-ptlhthnrrrrr Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1) Company: Priavoid GmbH",ongoing,1.0,False,,30 Sep 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/pri-002

Sigma1Rs are highly expressed in the central nervous system, and regulate calcium signaling, ion channel function, and the ER stress response. In various experimental systems, sigma1R agonists have been reported to be neuroprotective by improving mitochondrial function and neurotropic signaling, clearing toxic proteins, and decreasing neuroinflammation. The companies NeuroSearch and then Teva Pharmaceuticals originally began developing pridopidine for Huntington’s disease; Prilenia took over the program in 2018. In preclinical work, pridopidine was studied extensively in cell-based mouse models of Huntington's, and was also reported to show beneficial effects across models of ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases (reviewed in Ryskamp et al., 2019 ). For example, in the PS1 knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's, pridopidine rescued synaptic damage induced by Aβ42 ( Ryskamp et al., 2019 ). It promoted synaptogenesis in primary neurons and improved spatial memory in APP/PS1 transgenic mice; it increased BDNF availability in a microfluidic model of striatal neurons, and it modified the disease phenotype but did not extend survival in an ALS mouse model ( Estevez-Silva et al., 2022 ; Lenoir et al., 2022 ; Estevez-Silva et al., 2022 ). Effects facilitating autophagy in cell-based models have been reported, as well, as have effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma models ( Wang et al., 2023 ; Shenkman et al., 2021 ; Geva et al., 2021 ). Other compounds with sigma1R agonist activity are in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease; they include blarcamesine and AXS-05 . The dextromethorphan drugs edonerpic and AVP-786 failed trials and were discontinued; AVP-923 was approved to treat pseudobulbar affect in people with ALS or multiple sclerosis. Pridopidine was originally postulated to act through dopamine receptors, and was therefore developed initially for the treatment of motor symptoms in HD. However, in vitro binding assays, as well as studies in preclinical models, showed its effects occur specifically through sigma1Rs (e.g., Ryskamp et al., 2017 ).

It was developed as an adjuvant to enhance mucosal immune responses to intranasal flu and other vaccines ( Jones et al., 2004 ). Protollin stimulates the innate immune system through toll-like receptors. The rationale for its use as an Alzheimer’s vaccine comes from preclinical work in APP-transgenic mice, where nasal Protollin stimulated clearance of brain amyloid, apparently by activating peripheral monocytes to enter the brain and phagocytose Aβ ( Frenkel et al., 2005 ; Frenkel et al., 2008 ). Removal of brain amyloid did not require an antibody response. Protollin was shown to elevate expression of the Aβ scavenger receptor Scara1 on mouse microglia ( Frenkel et al., 2013 ); in human microglia cultures, it slightly increased phagocytosis of Aβ42 ( Hjorth et al, 2010 ). In a mouse model of cerebral vascular amyloidosis, nasal vaccination with Protollin reduced amyloid in blood vessels, prevented microhemorrhages, and improved cognition ( Lifshitz et al., 2012 ).

HSP90 stabilizes mutant or aberrantly modified proteins associated with cancer and multiple neurodegenerative diseases. HSP90 inhibitors enhance degradation of pathogenic proteins and promote cell survival in animal models of tau pathology, and of Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (reviewed in Carman et al., 2013 ). Brain-penetrant HSP90 inhibitors were reported to enhance the degradation of mutated or hyperphosphorylated tau in mouse models ( May 2007 news ). Another brain-penetrant inhibitor enhanced working memory and spatial learning/memory in Tg2576 AD mice, and improved conditioned fear memory after infusion of Aβ into the brain ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Although all cells express HSP90 at high levels, PU-AD and some other HSP90 inhibitors bind with high affinity to HSP90 from cancer cells and AD tissue, but not from normal tissue, suggesting the possibility of selective inhibition in disease states ( Moulick et al., 2011 ; Dickey et al., 2007 ). Affinity purification using PU-AD, and proteomic analyses, have identified HSP90-centered, stable chaperone complexes that emerge in cells under stress, including in cancer, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s diseases ( Rodina et al., 2016 ; Kishinevsky et al., 2018 ; Joshi et al., 2018 ). In AD tissues and mouse models, these complexes, dubbed epichaperomes, incorporate cell proteins not normally associated with HSP90, including some involved in synaptic function, learning, and memory. PU-AD treatment dissociates the epichaperome, and restores HSP90’s normal protein associations ( Inda et al., 2020 ). PU-AD has been tested in the PS19 tau mouse and the 3xTg mouse . After 6 to 12 weeks of thrice-weekly dosing, 3-month-old or 8- to 9-month-old PS19 mice performed better on learning and memory trials in a Barnes maze, compared to untreated animals ( Inda et al., 2020 ). Treatment also normalized deficits in synaptic long-term potentiation, extended life span, and decreased phospho-tau and tau oligomers in multiple brain regions.

Tofersen is being developed for ALS caused by SOD1 mutations, which account for about 20 percent of all familial ALS and 2 percent of all ALS cases. Although the exact pathological mechanism remains unknown, mutant SOD1 is believed to exert a toxic action on motor neurons, and reducing its levels may be beneficial. In 2013, Ionis tested a first-generation SOD1 ASO, which proved safe in people, but lacked potency ( May 2013 news ). The company then screened 2,000 SOD1 ASOs and identified two targeting the mRNA 3' untranslated region that were most effective at lowering SOD1 mRNA and protein levels in cells. Injection of ASO1 into the brains or spinal cords of mice or rats expressing mutant SOD1 reduced spinal-cord levels of SOD1 mRNA and protein. A single injection delayed disease onset, improved motor function, and increased survival in the animals. ASO1 treatment preserved neuromuscular innervation and stemmed the rise of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain in blood, a prognostic biomarker for ALS. In nonhuman primates, ASO1 lowered SOD mRNA in the CNS after spinal-cord injection ( Jul 2018 news on McCampbell et al., 2018 ).

QRL-101 is being developed to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with the aim to reduce hyperexcitability-induced motor neuron degeneration. It is taken by mouth. Kv7 potassium channels were identified as a drug target for ALS using motor neurons derived from patient fibroblasts. In those cells, the channel opener retigabine reversed the cells’ intrinsic hyperexcitability ( Wainger et al, 2014 ). A subsequent high-throughput unbiased screen using patient-derived cells identified the Kv7.2/7.3 subtypes as suppressors of hyperexcitability ( Huang et al., 2021 ). In clinical studies, retigabine, also known as ezogabine, decreased cortical and spinal motor neuron hyperexcitability in ALS patients ( Kovalchuk et al., 2018 ; Wainger et al., 2021 ). Retigabine was approved to treat epilepsy in 2011, but was taken off the market a few years later due to safety issues. Among other effects, the drug caused blue skin discoloration and eye abnormalities ( Clark et al., 2015 ).

This gene encodes stathmin-2, a microtubule-binding protein abundant in motor neurons and critical for axon stability. Errors in STMN2 transcript splicing lead to decreased protein expression and precipitate neurodegeneration in cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. QRL-201 is designed to modulate splicing of the STMN2 mRNA to restore protein expression. It is delivered by injection into the spinal cord. STMN2 expression is controlled by the RNA-binding protein TDP-43, which is found mislocalized and aggregated in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, and half of frontotemporal dementia cases. In cells without functioning TDP-43, STMN2 mRNA transcripts fail to splice properly or produce protein, leading to cell degeneration ( Klim et al., 2019 ; Melamed et al., 2019 ). In preclinical work, an ASO that corrects STMN2 splicing restored protein expression in TDP-43-deficient human motor neurons, or in mice with misprocessed STMN2 mRNAs ( Baughn et al., 2023 ). Studies with patient tissue found truncated STMN2 mRNA serves as a marker of TDP-43 pathology in motor neurons and brain tissue ( Prudencio, et al., 2020 ; Pickles et al., 2022 ).

PB is prescribed under the brand name Buphenyl to treat urea cycle disorders. It acts as a scavenger to facilitate the excretion of excess nitrogen. Interest in repurposing PB to treat neurodegenerative diseases stems from its action as a chemical chaperone, which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and neuronal cell death induced by accumulation of misfolded or mutant proteins ( Kubota et al., 2006 ). PB also epigenetically regulates gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase. TUDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid with anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects. TUDCA has been used for centuries in Asian medicine, and is widely available over the counter as a nutritional supplement. It is used clinically to help dissolve gallstones, and treat some forms of liver disease. TUDCA inhibits mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and the formation of reactive oxygen species, and blocks apoptosis caused by ER stress (reviewed in Daruich et al., 2019 ). The only preclinical data comparing AMX0035 to PB and TUDCA individually describes gene expression and metabolomic changes in ALS patient-derived primary skin cells ( Fels et al., 2022 ). The combination changed more genes and different genes than did PB or TUDCA alone. Both compounds show activity in mouse models of neurodegeneration. PB resulted in fewer plaques and better performance in a spatial memory task in APPswePS1delta9 ( Wiley et al., 2011 ). PB prolonged survival in an ALS mouse model, both when given alone and together with riluzole ( Ryu et al., 2005 ; Del Signore et al., 2009 ). PB was also reported to protect against neurodegeneration in models of α-synuclein toxicity and Parkinson’s disease ( Sturm et al., 2016 ; Ono et al., 2009 ). TUDCA reduced amyloid deposition and improved cognition in APP/PS1 mice ( Nunes et al., 2012 ). It also improved pathology and behavior in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, HD, and ALS (reviewed by Ackerman and Gerhard, 2016 ). In a clinical study conducted 10 years ago in Milan, Italy, TUDCA alone reportedly had a treatment benefit in ALS. In a Phase 2 trial in 34 ALS patients, treatment with 2 g per day for one year slowed deterioration on the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) compared with placebo ( Elia et al., 2015 ). Post hoc analysis suggested a reduced risk of death during the trial ( Reggiardo et al., 2023 ). Following those results, investigators in February 2019 began a Phase 3 trial of TUDCA ( Albanese et al., 2022 ).

It acts as a molecular glue to stabilize the septin cytoskeleton, and normalizes neuronal calcium signaling that is altered by pathological tau. It is being developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Septin family members regulate microtubule dynamics, interact with phosphorylated tau, and get incorporated into neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains ( Drummond et al., 2020 ; Kinoshita et al., 1998 ). REM0045392’s target is septin6, a guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)–binding protein that assembles with other septin family members into filaments on the inside of the cell membrane. Septin modulators were discovered in a screen for small molecules able to reverse calcium dysregulation in neuroblastoma cells expressing mutant tau ( Princen et al., 2024 ). Aberrant tau accumulation was found to disrupt septin filaments, which led to unregulated calcium influx through store-operated calcium entry channels. This influx resulted in a prolonged rise in cytoplasmic calcium and calcium overload. The most potent compound, REM0046127 (REM127), restored septin filament assembly and calcium homeostasis, and reduced P301L tau toxicity at nanomolar concentrations. It also protected rat hippocampal neurons from Aβ oligomer-induced cell death. In patient-derived neurons expressing P301L tau, REM127 normalized calcium levels and synaptic activity. The compound did not affect calcium flux in cells without tau pathology. In Aβ or tau mutant mice, oral dosing with REM127 restored synaptic plasticity, normalized EEG brain waves, and attenuated amyloid and tau pathology. In Aβ amyloidosis mice, treatment improved recall in the Morris water maze. Structural and biochemical studies localized REM127’s binding site to the interface of septin subunits, where it promoted filament formation.",Overview Name: REM0045392 Synonyms: REM392 Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Tau (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 1) Company: remynd,ongoing,1.0,False,,12 Oct 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/rem0045392

This old drug predates the FDA.","Background Rember® is a purified, proprietary formulation of methylthioninium chloride (MTC), also known as methylene blue. This old drug predates the FDA. It is being widely used in Africa to treat malaria, as well as methemoglobinemia and other conditions. Rember was TauRx's first-generation compound; it has since been replaced by TRx0237 . The rationale behind both TRx 0237 and Rember TM is that these compounds prevent tau aggregation or dissolve existing aggregates to interfere with downstream pathological consequences of aberrant tau in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Tau pathology is widely considered to be downstream of Aβ pathology and is linked more closely to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in the tau gene cause frontotemporal dementia, not Alzheimer's disease, but tau is considered a central drug target for all tauopathies, including Alzheimer's. Prior to the first publicized Phase 2 trial of Rember TM in 2008 (see Aug 2008 conference story ), one peer-reviewed paper to support this rationale had been published. It reported that methylene blue interfered with the tau-tau binding necessary for aggregation (see Wischik et al., 1996 ). Since 2008, numerous investigations of the commercially available parent compound, methylene blue, have reported potentially beneficial effects on a growing list of cellular and system-level endpoints, including tau fibrillization in vitro (see Crowe et al., 2013 ), autophagy (see Congdon et al., 2012 ), neuroprotection via mitochondrial antioxidant properties (see Wen et al., 2011 ), as well as Aβ clearance and proteasome function in transgenic AD and tauopathy mouse models (see Medina et al., 2011 ) and spatial learning and brain metabolism in rats (see Deiana et al., 2009 ; Riha et al., 2011 ). A mechanistic study found that methylene blue oxidizes cysteine sulfhydryl groups on tau to keep tau monomeric (see Feb 2013 news ). One preclinical treatment study in tauopathy mice reported anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective effects mediated by the Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE); another reported insoluble tau reduction and a learning and memory benefit when given early (see Stack et al., 2014 , Hochgräfe et al., 2015 ). Some studies reported a generalized anti-aggregation effect for methylene blue against aggregation-prone proteins, such as prion protein and TDP-43 (see Cavaliere et al., 2012 ; Arai et al., 2010 ). However, findings are mixed, with other papers reporting no inhibition of tau- and polyglutamine-mediated neurotoxicity in vivo (see van Bebber et al., 2010 ).","Overview Name: Rember TM Synonyms: Methylene Blue , methylthioninium (MT), TRx-0014, Tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI) Chemical Name: 3,7-Bis(dimethylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium chloride Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Tau (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: TauRx Therapeutics Ltd Approved for: Methylene Blue predates FDA.

Also known as plasma platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase, this enzyme is released into the blood by monocytes/macrophages. Lp-PLA2 can have pro-inflammatory and oxidative properties; it is associated with LDL cholesterol and linked to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Rilapladib was originally developed for atherosclerosis, but GSK discontinued this indication in Phase 2. Lp-PLA2 drew interest as a target in Alzheimer's disease when research into the brain's lipid metabolism identified it as a potential factor in cerebrovascular oxidative stress and inflammation. Some studies implicated Lp-PLA2 produced locally in vascular plaques with endothelial dysfunction ( Lavi et al., 2007 ; Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2008 ). Another Lp-PLA2 ihibitor, darapladib, lowered the total amount of brain Aβ in diabetic and hypercholesterolemic pigs ( Acharya et al., 2013 ). The epidemiological evidence is mixed. Some studies have linked Lp-PLA2 to increased risk for ischemic stroke and developing dementia ( Oei et al., 2005 ; van Oijen et al., 2006 ; Fitzpatrick et al., 2014 ). However, the Framingham Heart Study was unable to associate Lp-PLA with risk for dementia, or with microbleeds as indicators of cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( van Himbergen et al., 2012 ; Romero et al., 2012 ). Genetic association studies of Lp-PLA2 have been largely negative. A case-control study of cognitively normal and cognitively impaired people reported no association between plasma Lp-PLA2 levels and cognition ( Davidson et al., 2012 ).

The nanobubbles allow oxygen to be retained in the solution for longer and at higher concentrations compared to conventionally dissolved oxygen. RNS60 is delivered intravenously or by inhalation. It is unclear where or how the oxygen is delivered to cells. According to preclinical work funded by Revalesio, RNS60 can activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase) to promote anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective actions ( Dec 2014 conference news ; Jana et al., 2018 ). Independent researchers reported increased mitochondrial activity, ATP production, and synaptic activity in cells treated with RNS60 ( Choi et al., 2014 ; Choi et al., 2015 ), as well as improved neurotransmission and reduced fatigue in isolated muscle preparations ( Ivannikov et al., 2017 ). Revalesio-funded work claimed neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease of 300 μl daily intraperitoneal injections or delivery by nebulizer ( Khasnavis et al., 2014 ; Mondal et al., 2017 ). The proposed mechanism was enhancement of regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Another study reported upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis and increased levels of neuroprotective gene expression in isolated dopaminergic neurons after RNS60 exposure ( Chandra et al., 2018 ; Jana et al., 2023 ). In the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, intraperitoneal injection of 300 μl RNS60 every other day for two months reportedly suppressed neuronal apoptosis, attenuated tau phosphorylation, inhibited glial activation, reduced hippocampal Aβ, and improved memory and learning ( Modi et al., 2014 ). RNS60 was also claimed to enhance expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity, and to increase calcium influx in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Roy et al., 2014 ). Other company-funded or co-authored studies reported beneficial effects of intraperitoneal administration in the SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS ( Vallarola et al., 2018 ), and models of traumatic brain injury ( Rangasamy et al., 2020 ), heart attack ( Zabielska-Kaczorowska et al., 2022 ), and stroke ( Baena-Caldas et al., 2024 ). Starting in 2014, Revalesio’s subsidiary Reliant Hydration briefly marketed an oxygenated water for athletic performance and recovery ( press release ). In 40 healthy adults, drinking the water for 23 days was claimed to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation, and improve muscle recovery ( Borsa et al., 2013 ). A Phase 1 trial, run from 2012-2015 at New York University, tested the water against placebo for changes in brain activity measured by magnetoencephalography in healthy adults. No results were made public. The product drew an FDA warning when a National Football League player and company investor claimed the water protected him against concussion ( 2015 news ).

Its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects appear to result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib amid controversy over cardiovascular side effects ( Sep 2004 news story ). In Alzheimer's research, interest in NSAIDs arose when epidemiological studies started reporting lower rates of Alzheimer's disease or protection of cognition among people who had been taking these drugs for chronic treatment of inflammatory conditions (e.g., Mar 1997 news story ; in't Veld et al., 1998 ; Nov 2001 news story ; Vlad et al., 2008 ; Obermann et al., 2013 ).

Rosiglitazone belongs to the thiazolidinedione class of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor γ agonists; PPARγ is a nuclear receptor predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, whose activation influences expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. The FDA approved rosiglitazone for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in 1999, but side effects soon started being reported ( Sep 2003 news ) and their use was restricted in 2010 after having been linked to heart attacks and strokes (see New York Times article ). PPARγ has come to be a target of interest for Alzheimer's drug development because of an overlap of metabolic disease and Alzheimer's disease risk factors. Cell-based and animal studies have implicated PPARγ, in particular, as playing a role in neuroinflammatory processes in neurodegenerative conditions. For example, PPARγ activation has been shown to modulate the microglial response to amyloid deposition in such a way that it increases Aβ phagocytosis and decreases cytokine release (see Dec 2012 news story ; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2012 ). Rosiglitazone has been variously reported to improve behavioral outcomes, normalize brain glucocorticoid receptor levels, activate wnt signaling, and decrease insoluble Aβ42 levels in mutant human APP/PS transgenic mice ( Pedersen et al, 2006 ; Escribano et al., 2009 ; Toledo and Inestrosa, 2010 ; O'Reilly and Lynch, 2011 ).

Psychosis and impulse control disorders like pathological gambling are rare but serious side effects ( Rotigotine, 2017 ). In Alzheimer’s disease, deficits in dopamine signaling may contribute to cognitive decline. Decrements in executive function associated with diminished frontal cortical activity further diminish daily function, separate from memory loss. A group in Rome has investigated rotigotine’s effect on cortical function and plasticity in people with Alzheimer’s by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The drug reportedly upped cortical excitability and cholinergic transmission, reversing impairments in LTP-like cortical plasticity in these patients. In a small study of 30 people, rotigotine treatment for 24 weeks was reported to improve scores on the MMSE and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), which tests cognitive functions related to prefrontal cortical activity ( Martorana et al., 2013 ; Koch et al., 2014 ).

This antibody emerged from a research and development collaboration forged in 2004 between Acumen and Merck. The partnership ended in 2011, at which point Acumen regained development rights. Preclinical work on ACU193 has been presented at meetings. In 2013, Acumen reported that the antibody binds to soluble Aβ oligomers with low nanomolar affinity and greater than 500-fold selectivity over Aβ monomers or fibrils. ACU193 blocked oligomers from interacting with cultured hippocampal neurons at an IC50 of 17 nM, and was unaffected by addition of excess Aβ monomer. In Tg-AD mice, ACU193 bound soluble oligomers in brain tissue, lessened plaque deposition, and was claimed to reduce abnormal nighttime hyperactivity.

The role of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in brain function, and in neurodegenerative diseases, is complex and controversial. It is the most abundant cholesterol metabolite in the brain. Some studies, but not all, suggest its levels decrease with aging and in AD. It has been reported to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on neuronal function, survival, and amyloid or tau pathology (reviewed by Gamba et al., 2021 ). Work from SAGE and other labs reported decreases in plasma 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol in patients with Huntington’s disease, which correlated with more severe cognitive symptoms ( 2019 ACNP poster M-147 ; see also Leoni et al., 2008 ).

It was originally developed by AstraZeneca for various types of cancer, but discontinued in Phase 2 for lack of efficacy. The Discovering New Therapeutic Uses program at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) funded a grant to Stephen Strittmatter and colleagues at Yale University to explore the clinical use of saracatinib for Alzheimer's through Phase 2a. Through its Open Innovation Initiative , AstraZeneca agreed to supply the drug and matching placebo for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease (see NIH Director's blog ). The rationale for this repurposing grew out of work on the tyrosine kinase Fyn. This member of the src kinase family is expressed in the brain and involved in signal transduction pathways underpinning synaptic plasticity. Fyn is believed to mediate Aβ toxicity. For example, it has been reported to become activated in the postsynapse in response to interactions at the postsynaptic plasma membrane between oligomeric Aβ, the prion protein, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5. A separate line of evidence has linked Fyn to tau; reporting, for example, that Fyn phosphorylates dendritic tau, which then localizes Fyn to the postsynaptic density ( Um, et al. 2012 ; Ittner et al., 2010 ; for review see Nygaard et al., 2014 ). Fyn has also been implicated in aspects of Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (reviewed in Angelopoulou et al., 2022 ). Preclinical treatment studies reported that AZD0530 blocked Fyn in brain slices, rescued synaptic depletion and spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice, and that the treatment effect persisted after drug washout ( Kaufman et al., 2015 , Smith et al., 2018 ). In the same mouse line, AZD0530 was reported to boost hippocampal synaptic density, as measured with a PET ligand that binds synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A ( Toyonaga et al., 2019 ). AZD0530 inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization in cell-based assays ( Yadikar et al., 2020 ). In animal models of tauopathy, it reduced accumulation of hippocampal p-tau and glial activation, promoted recovery of synaptic markers, and prevented memory and learning deficits ( Tang et al., 2020 ).","Overview Name: Saracatinib Synonyms: AZD0530 Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued), Parkinson's Disease (Phase 1) Company: AstraZeneca",discontinued,2.0,False,1.0,24 Jul 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/saracatinib

It is a 127-amino-acid glycoprotein produced by recombinant DNA technology in yeast. Sargramostim stimulates the innate immune system. It is FDA-approved for regenerating neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages after bone marrow transplants, radiation therapy, and in conjunction with treatment for several types of leukemia. Sargramostim is also used for treating neutropenia, a condition of dangerously low white-blood-cell counts. Sargramostim is not to be confused with filgrastim, a recombinant form of the related granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The rationale for evaluating this immune modulator in Alzheimer's disease is that it might increase phagocytosis of pathogenic protein deposits by bone-marrow-derived macrophages or brain-resident microglia, and that it might also stimulate other neuroprotective innate immunity processes (see review by Ahmed et al., 2021 ). GM-CSF was reported to activate microglia in response to amyloid pathology without also augmenting microglial release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as is seen in response to other, closely related neurotrophic factors ( Murphy et al., 1998 ). In transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, GM-CSF was reported to reduce amyloid pathology, improve cognition, and increase the number of microglia ( Boyd et al., 2010 ; Kiyota et al., 2018 ). However, contradictory findings exist, as well ( Manczak et al, 2009 ). GM-CSF was also tested in Dp16 Down syndrome mice, a model that does not accumulate amyloid but does develop cognitive deficits due to neuroinflammation. Treatment reduced inflammation in the mice, and improved learning and memory in both DP16 and wild-type mice ( Ahmed et al., 2022 ). Both GM-CSF and its receptor appear to be expressed in aging human brains, both in controls and in people with Alzheimer's ( Ridwan et al., 2012 ). Analysis of archived neuropsychology data from 19 patients who had received sargramostim as part of their supportive care for bone-marrow transplantation reported a cognitive benefit ( Jim et al., 2012 ). Sargramostim is also of interest in Parkinson’s disease, where T cell immune responses have been linked to dopaminergic neuron loss and motor dysfunction ( Reynolds et al., 2010 ; Saunders et al., 2012 ; Benner et al., 2008 ).

Inflammasomes are multiprotein, cytosolic complexes that function as sensors in the innate immune system. Their activation by pathologic proteins and other stressors triggers production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL1-β and IL-18, and can induce cell death. NLRP3-containing inflammasome activation occurs in many conditions where chronic inflammation plays a role, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (reviewed in Heneka et al., 2018 ). Multiple NLRP3 inhibitors are in clinical trials for a range of inflammatory diseases ( Li et al., 2023 ). According to company information, selnoflast does not enter the brain. NLRP3 is a receptor for Aβ, and mediates the innate immune response to amyloid in microglia, cells involved in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis ( Halle et al., 2008 ). Deleting NLRP3 in the APP/PS1 mouse model diminishes Aβ deposition, synapse loss, and memory deficits ( Heneka et al., 2013 ). Loss of NLRP3 also prevents tau tangle formation in human tau-expressing mice in response to injected Aβ ( Ising et al., 2019 ).

Ozempic TM is a once-per-week injection formulation, while Rybelsus TM is is a daily pill. Rybelsus TM was approved by the U.S. FDA in September 2019 as the first GLP-1 analog that does not need to be injected. It is also approved for use in Japan and the European Union. GLP-1 is a hormone produced in the gut that activates receptors in the gut, liver, and pancreas to stimulate insulin release, and restore insulin sensitivity (for review, see Knudsen and Lau, 2019 ). In some people with Alzheimer’s disease, there is evidence for insulin resistance in the brain, providing a rationale for testing semaglutide as a potential therapeutic for AD. In addition, GLP-1 receptors expressed in the brain are involved in learning and neuroprotection ( During et al., 2003 ). Other GLP-1 analogs, for example exendin-4 , liraglutide , and lixisenatide , are currently in clinical trials for Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s diseases. There are several published preclinical studies for semaglutide in Alzheimer’s. A cell-based study implicated the drug in enhanced autophagy and reduced apoptosis ( Chang et al., 2020 ). In a 3xTg mouse model of AD, semaglutide improved brain glucose uptake, improved learning and memory, and decreased Aβ plaques and tau tangles ( Wang et al., 2023 ). An independent study using the APP/PS1 model reported similar positive results ( Zhang et al., 2024 ). In contrast, other researchers found that although semaglutide caused weight loss and improved glucose tolerance in 5XFAD and APP/PS1 mice, it did not change amyloid plaque density, inflammation markers, or cognitive function ( Germano et al., 2024 ).The drug is reported to be active in rodent models of Parkinson’s ( Zhang et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ) and stroke ( Yang et al., 2019 ).

The company developed a wearable GammaSense Stimulation device. It pairs headphones and opaque glasses to deliver light and sound stimuli at gamma band frequency in order to entrain gamma oscillations in the brain. An LED light flashing at 40 Hz for one hour was reported to boost gamma power in the visual (V1), prefrontal, and somatosensory cortices, and hippocampal CA1; it also increases synchronization between V1 and the other regions. A combination of light and sound at 40 Hz has been shown to strengthen gamma oscillations throughout the auditory cortex, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex. Gamma oscillations play a role in sensory processing, cognition, and memory consolidation, and are weakened in AD. In 5XFAD , APPPS1 , and wild-type mice, one hour of light-based GENUS reportedly halved Aβ levels, and one week of GENUS in 6-month-old 5XFAD mice cut amyloid plaque load by two-thirds. In TauP301S , this regimen cut phosphorylated tau by 40 percent ( Iaccarino et al., 2016 ). Neuron numbers were maintained in TauP301S mice for three weeks with GENUS starting at 7.5 months of age, when neurodegeneration begins in this model. In the inducible p25 neurodegeneration mouse model, six weeks of GENUS preserved neuron number and cortical thickness. In both models, GENUS maintained neuronal expression of genes affecting synaptic transmission and vesicle trafficking, protected DNA, increased the density of mushroom spines, and improved performance in the Morris water maze. In all models tested, GENUS lowered microgliosis and inflammatory gene expression, while increasing internalization of Aβ ( Adaikkan et al., 2019 ). The combination of light and sound at 40 Hz in 6-month-old 5XFAD mice had similar effects to light alone, but reached more brain areas ( Martorell et al., 2019 ). In other studies, 40 Hz light flicker or ultrasound was reported to improve cognitive function, enhance presynaptic plasticity, and activate microglia to reduce Aβ plaque load ( Singer et al., 2018 ; Park et al., 2020 ; Zheng et al., 2020 ; Bobola et al., 2020 ). A separate study linked acoustic stimulation to lowered amyloid plaques and increased microglial numbers in the hippocampi of 5XFAD mice ( Lee et al., 2018 ). Multisensory 40 Hz stimulation was reported to increase glymphatic clearance of Aβ in the same model ( Murdock et al., 2024 ), and to restore hippocampal synaptic potentiation in rat models ( Yang et al., 2023 ). Other reported effects of 40 Hz light flicker in AD preclinical models include increased expression of cytokines that regulate microglia ( Garza et al., 2020 ; Prichard et al., 2023 ), normalization of circadian rhythms, altered APP processing, and improved effects of exercise on cognition ( Yao et al., 2020 ; Shen et al., 2022 ; Park et al., 2022 ). In one study using 40 Hz optogenetic stimulation, hippocampal gamma waves and spatial memory changed, but plaque load did not. In another, plaques grew; memory was not assessed ( Etter et al., 2019 ; Wilson et al., 2020 ). In other negative studies, native gamma oscillation entrainment, amyloid lowering, and microglial activation were not replicated ( Soula et al., 2023 ; Yang and Lai, 2023 ). Transgenic AD rats increased their activity, but did not improve cognition, after light and sound stimulation ( Bentley and Broussad, 2024 ). For reviews, see McDermott et al., 2018 ; Adaikkan and Tsai, 2020 ; Manippa et al., 2022; Blanco-Duque et al., 2024 ).

Preclinical studies suggest that PTI-125 prevents and reverses the binding of Aβ42 to α7nAChR. In one, daily infusions of human synthetic Aβ42 into mouse cerebral ventricles resulted in association of Aβ42 and filamin with α7 receptors in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Concomitant intraperitoneal PTI-125 injections prevented this association, reduced tau phosphorylation and amyloid deposition, and normalized signaling through the α7, NDMA, and insulin receptors. PTI-125 reportedly tamped down Aβ-induced inflammatory cytokine release by blocking filamin recruitment to toll-like receptor 4. When applied to human AD postmortem brain tissue, PTI-125 was reported to cause filamin and Aβ42 to dissociate from the α7 receptor ( Jul 2012 news ). Subsequently, the same group reported that simufilam could inhibit Aβ42-induced filamin A interactions with multiple inflammatory receptors ( Wang et al., 2023 ). These studies used immunoprecipitation and western blotting to quantitate protein-protein interactions. One study using fluorescence resonance energy transfer in intact cells reported that simufilam reduced Aβ42 binding to α7 with picomolar potency ( Wang et al., 2023 ). Two months of oral PTI-125 in 3xTg AD mice reportedly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid and tau deposition, and neuroinflammation, and restored synaptic function, nesting behavior, and spatial and working memory relative to untreated mice. The study claimed that Aβ42 induces a conformational change in filamin, which would promote its association with the α7 and toll-like receptors, enabling Aβ42 toxicity and inflammation. PTI-125 was said to preferentially bind altered filamin and normalize its conformation ( Wang et al., 2017 ). Most research on filamin, Aβ42 and Alzheimer's comes from the same laboratory, although several independent studies have implicated filamin in AD and progressive supranuclear palsy ( Levert et al., 2023 ; Aumont et al., 2022 ; Tsujikawa et al., 2022 ).","Overview Name: Simufilam Synonyms: PTI-125, sumifilam Chemical Name: 4-benzyl-8-methyl-1,4,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decan-3-one Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Discontinued) Company: Cassava Sciences",discontinued,2.0,False,1.0,26 Sep 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/simufilam

Simvastatin was developed by Merck, Sharp & Dohme.","Background Simvastatin is an oral HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor prescribed extensively throughout the world for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Simvastatin was developed by Merck, Sharp & Dohme. Since its FDA approval in 1991, it has come to be marketed by a variety of companies under different brand names in different countries. The drug's indication calls for it to be used along with dietary changes to reduce elevated levels of total or LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Elevated LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol both are risk factors for heart disease. Simvastatin is a methylated form of lovastatin. In vivo, it is hydrolyzed to generate a metabolite that competes with the substrate HMG-CoA for the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase; this interference with the enzyme's activity reduces the level of the cholesterol precursor mevalonic acid. Simvastatin reduces mortality and the risk of nonfatal heart attacks in people with hypercholesterolemia. Its side effects include a risk for muscle injury, and its label and dosing regimen has been updated accordingly. In the United Kingdom, simvastatin is available over the counter; in some countries generic forms are sold. Simvastatin is widely used in a secondary prevention mode in routine medical care, where screening for elevated risk of cardiovascular disease with a cholesterol blood test in midlife can trigger prescription of statin therapy. Along with other statins, the clinical success and development path of simvastatin has served as a conceptual model for developing anti-amyloid drugs as a secondary prevention tool to treat preclinical Alzheimer's disease (see eFAD essay ). Simvastatin, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, has been tested for the treatment of symptomatic and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The rationale grew out of epidemiological research that suggested significant overlap between cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases. For example, long-term statin treatment to lower cholesterol was shown to confer some protection against incident Alzheimer's and AD neuropathology at death. A large body of literature on cell biology and animal studies suggests that statin treatment affects APP processing, lowers levels of the Aβ peptide, and might have neuroprotective effects. Small clinical trials generated signals of a possible benefit that did not hold up in larger treatment trials; trials targeting earlier stages of the disease are still ongoing (see below).","Overview Name: Simvastatin Synonyms: Zocor®, Lipex®, Lipovas®, Denan® Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Cholesterol Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Inactive), Mild Cognitive Impairment (Phase 4) Company: Merck Approved for: Hypercholesterolemia and diabetic cardiomyopathy.",ongoing,4.0,True,,25 Oct 2023,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/simvastatin

Histamine H3 receptors are widely expressed in healthy and Alzheimer's disease brains ( Medhurst et al., 2009 ). They exert neuromodulatory functions on the cholinergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Preclinically, inhibiting this receptor has been shown in mice and rats to enhance cholinergic signaling, reduce tau phosphorylation, and reverse behavioral deficits ( Medhurst et al., 2007 ; Bitner et al., 2011 ). Previous histamine H3 receptor antagonists that were in Phase 2 clinical development for cognition in Alzheimer's include Servier's S 38093 , ABT 288 , and GSK239512 . SUVN-G3031 was described to have nM potency as an inverse against at H3 receptors, and marked wake-promoting activity in rats ( Nirogi et al., 2019 ).

SUVN-G3031 increased brain acetylcholine levels, and acted synergistically with suboptimal doses of donepezil to improve performance in the Morris water maze ( Nirogi et al., 2021 ). At 10 times higher doses, it increased cortical levels of histamine, norepinephrine and dopamine in rats, and promoted wakefulness in rats and mice ( Nirogi et al., 2021 ).

In February 2020, Suvorexant became the first medication to be approved for treating sleep disorders in Alzheimer’s disease ( company press release ; FDA prescribing information ). Suvorexant is taken by mouth. Suvorexant was reported to have a lower potential for abuse, and be generally safer, than other sleep medications frequently used in aging populations, such as benzodiazepines ( Okino et al., 2023 ; Moline et al., 2023 ; Pan et al., 2023 ; Katsuta et al., 2023 ). Orexin is a neuropeptide produced by the hypothalamus. It promotes wakefulness, and blocking its receptor promotes sleep. Many people with AD suffer from disruption of circadian rhythms that leads to poor sleep, nighttime activity and daytime sleepiness. Circadian disruption is a frequent cause of institutionalization ( Harper et al., 2005 ). Changes in sleep/wake cycles also occur in preclinical AD, and are linked to increased amyloid deposition and risk of cognitive decline ( Oct 2013 news ; Ju et al., 2013 ; Musiek et al., 2018 ). Thus, sleep aids are of interest as potential disease modifiers. CSF orexin levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease ( Oct 2014 news ).

It is being developed as an oral therapy for Alzheimer’s disease. In 2013, T3D Therapeutics acquired this compound from DARA BioSciences. In 2010 and 2011, DARA BioSciences had tested DB959 in Phase 1 trials for dyslipidemia and Type 2 diabetes, but subsequently shifted its focus to oncology care products. The PPAR family of proteins helps regulate blood sugar and triglyceride levels. PPAR activation affects these measures by boosting insulin sensitivity, and this approach has become a mainstay for correcting insulin resistance in diabetes therapy. The rationale for evaluating PPAR agonists in Alzheimer's is based on the hypothesis that sporadic AD is fundamentally an age-related metabolic disease, sometimes called Type 3 diabetes ( Sep 2006 conference news ; de la Monte and Tong, 2014 ). Unlike other PPAR-targeted diabetes drugs that have been evaluated in Alzheimer's previously, T3D-959 is not a thiazolidinedione.

Nonspecific dopamine receptor agonists currently used to treat PD have significant side effects, including daytime sleepiness, impulse control disorders, confusion, hallucinations, and dyskinesias. These effects are blamed on repeated stimulation of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Selectively activating D1/D5 dopamine receptors is a strategy to improve motor symptoms while reducing the risk of D2/D3-related adverse events. Partial agonism is thought to prevent receptor desensitization, which occurs with dopamine replacement and leads to loss of efficacy. Tavapadon is taken in tablet form. It enters the brain. Tavapadon binds both D1 and D5 receptors with nanomolar affinity, and is 375 to 750 times less potent at D2, D3, and D4 subtypes ( Bezard et al., 2024 ). Discovered at Pfizer, the compound belongs to a series of D1 partial agonists that cause less receptor desensitization, and showed more durable effectiveness at eliciting D1-dependent behaviors in nonhuman primate and rodent models, than full agonists ( Gray et al., 2018 ).

The rationale for targeting galectin 3 to treat Alzheimer’s disease comes from studies implicating it as a regulator of microglia activation in response to amyloid. Brain galectin 3 expression is increased in people with AD, specifically in microglia associated with amyloid plaques ( Boza-Serrano et al., 2019 ). The same study associated variants in LGALS3, the gene encoding galectin-3, with an increased risk of AD. In mouse studies, LGLAS3 is among the genes most upregulated in amyloid-plaque-associated microglia, and is part of a disease-associated expression signature in those cells ( Kraseman et al., 2017 ; Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 ; Butovsky and Weiner, 2018 ). Galectin-3 itself activates microglia by binding to TLR-4 receptors ( Burguillos et al., 2015 ). Galectin-3 also induces TREM2 signaling, and knocking it out in a mouse model of AD improved cognition and reduced amyloid plaque burden ( Boza-Serrano et al., 2019 ). In the APP/PS1 mouse amyloidosis model, galectin-3 promoted Aβ aggregation and toxicity ( Tao et al., 2019 ). Several small human studies have associated elevated galectin-3 in blood or CSF with cognitive impairment or with Alzheimer's disease ( Wang et al., 2013 ; Ashraf and Baeesa, 2018 ; Venkatraman et al., 2018 ; Yazar et al., 2020 ; Boza-Serrano et al., 2022 ).

Telmisartan is an alternative medication for people who are unable to take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.,"Background Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist marketed around the world to treat elevated blood pressure and reduce the possibility of cardiovascular risk associated with chronic hypertension. Telmisartan is an alternative medication for people who are unable to take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In March 2014, a generic version became available in the U.S. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been linked to reduced risk of AD. They act on the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure in the body and the brain. Angiotensin II receptors also mediate inflammation, blood-brain barrier maintenance, and neuron survival. Genetic, epidemiologic, and biological evidence implicates changes in the brain renin-angiotensin system in Alzheimer’s disease (reviewed in Kehoe 2018 ). ARB use is associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD (e.g., Wharton et al., 2015 ; Barthold et al., 2018 ; also see Walker et al., 2020 ). Telmisartan use has been associated with a lower risk of AD specifically in African Americans, and of dementia in East Asians with diabetes and hypertension ( Zhang et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2021 ). In people with mild cognitive impairment, use of ARBs, but not other antihypertensives, is linked to lower brain amyloid load and CSF tau ( Hajjar et al., 2012 ; Hajjar et al., 2015 ). Telmisartan has been proposed to slow AD pathogenesis by controlling cerebral blood flow, protecting the cerebral microvasculature, and reducing plaque formation in the brain (e.g., Baden et al., 2008 ; Mogi et al., 2008 ; Kurata et al., 2014 ). It acts via the peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor γ to reduce inflammation ( Fu et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2020 ).

THN391 was designed to block fibrin-mediated neuroinflammation without interfering with clotting functions. It recognizes an inflammatory epitope that is present on fibrin, but not its soluble precursor fibrinogen. This epitope activates innate immune cells, including microglia and macrophages, via their complement receptor 3 or 4; the antibody prevents immune activation. The lead clinical applications are Alzheimer’s and diabetic eye disease. The antibody is given by intravenous infusion; in diabetes patients it is injected into the eye. In Alzheimer’s, vascular disease, and other conditions, a leaky blood-brain barrier allows fibrinogen to enter the brain. There, it is cleaved into fibrin, which deposits in blood vessels and parenchyma and causes chronic inflammation (e.g., Mendiola et al., 2023 ). Epidemiological and animal studies link fibrin deposits, or high CSF and plasma fibrinogen levels, to neurodegeneration and the risk for dementia (reviewed in Kantor et al., 2023 ). Genetically, two APP mutations in the Aβ sequence cause hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy and stroke, Dutch E693Q and Iowa D694N ; both were reported to increase Aβ42 binding affinity to fibrinogen and lead to increased fibrin deposition ( Cajamarca et al., 2020 ). In AD mice, fibrinogen induced spine elimination and cognitive deficits by complement receptor-mediated microglia activation. In brain tissue from AD patients, focal fibrinogen deposits were associated with loss of dendritic spines, even in areas lacking amyloid plaques ( Merlini et al., 2019 ). THN391 is a humanized version of the mouse monoclonal antibody 5B8, which was developed to react to the P2 fibrin epitope γ377-395. The antibody has a LALA mutation to reduce Fc effector region. In mouse models of AD, 5B8 entered the CNS and bound to parenchymal fibrin. It reduced microglial activation and neurodegeneration around plaques, without affecting plaque or microglia number ( Ryu et al., 2018 ).

It is being repurposed based on recent work implicating the activation of retrotransposons in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases. It is taken as a once-daily, oral capsule formulation. The company says TPN-101 enters the brain. Retrotransposable elements are virus-derived pieces of DNA that make up a large part of the human genome. They are normally silenced by chromatin packing and other mechanisms. However, their tight regulation loosens with age, and there is evidence from fly and mouse models that reactivation of these elements by toxic tau species can drive neurodegeneration ( Sun et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2018 ; Ramirez et al., 2022 ; Jan 2023 news ). In ALS and frontotemporal dementia, the loss of functional nuclear TDP-43 protein is thought to cause reactivation of long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE1) and other retrotransposons, with expression of reverse transcriptase (e.g. Li et al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). The subsequent processing and accumulation of RNA products triggers an antiviral immune response in cells, and neuroinflammation subsequently leads to cell death (e.g. Rodriguez et al., 2021 ; LaRocca et al., 2019 ). By inhibiting LINE1 reverse transcriptase, TPN-101 is expected to prevent this immune response and protect cells. TPN-101 is a derivative of stavudine/D4T, an HIV treatment marketed from 1994 to 2020. The companies Oncolys BioPharma and Bristol Myers Squibb began to develop TPN-101 for HIV, but stopped in 2014 for business reasons ( pipeline ). In 2020, Transposon licensed the drug for neurodegeneration and other diseases. No preclinical work is published on TPN-101, but stavudine was reported to suppress neurodegeneration, measured in part via lifespan and dendritic collapse, in fruit fly models of TDP-43 toxicity or frontotemporal dementia ( Krug et al, 2017 ; Fort-Aznar et al., 2020 ).

It uses electrodes clipped on the outer ear to stimulate the auricular branch of the vagal nerve.,"Background This noninvasive approach attempts to modulate the noradrenergic system of the locus coeruleus by stimulating the vagal nerve. It uses electrodes clipped on the outer ear to stimulate the auricular branch of the vagal nerve. This procedure is under investigation for multiple indications, including mild cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, and motor and nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Auricular stimulation devices are sold in many countries; however, their efficacy has not been proven. Locus coeruleus neurons are the sole source of norepinephrine in the brain. They accumulate tau pathology and die early in the course of AD and PD (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2021 ). The resulting lack of norepinephrine impairs attention, learning, and behavior, and contributes to neuroinflammation ( Heneka et al. 2002 ; Bondareff et al., 1982 ). Vagal nerve stimulation increases hippocampal and cortical norepinephrine levels, and inhibits seizure-like neuron activity that contributes to cognitive decline. In human studies, a pilot, one-year open-label study in 17 AD patients reported that one year of vagal stimulation via implanted electrodes was well tolerated, and associated with improvement or stability on the MMSE or clinician impression of change in about three quarters of patients. Just under half of patients saw improvement or stability on the ADAS-Cog ( Sjogren et al., 2002 ; Merrill et al., 2006 ). In pilot studies, taVANS showed signs of improving cognition in older people. A single session of taVANS to the ear improved memory scores on a face-name recognition task, compared to a sham stimulation ( Jacobs et al., 2015 ). A follow-up study, reported at the 2020 AAIC, reported a larger effect using respiratory-gated stimulation ( Jacobs et al., 2020, abstract ). In this variation, electrical stimulation is synchronized with breathing and only occurs during exhalation. This type of stimulation enhanced the effects of taVANS on fMRI BOLD signals in the locus coeruleus and cortical areas, and increased functional connectivity between the locus coeruleus and the cortex, compared to stimulation during inhalation ( Sclocco et al., 2019 ). A comparison of stimulation at different frequencies found 100 Hz most effective at enhancing BOLD signals ( Sclocco et al., 2020 ). Most side effects of taVANS are mild and transient. In a systematic review, the most common were ear and headache pain, tingling, and skin redness ( Kim et al., 2022 ). In animal work, brief noninvasive stimulation of the vagal nerve in the necks of APP/PS1 mice changed microglia morphology ( Kaczmarczyk et al., 2017 ). Vagal nerve stimulation was reported to reduce Aβ-induced measures of anxiety and depression ( Yesiltepe et al. 2022 ) improved performance on cognitive tests of spatial memory and learning ( Yu et al., 2023 ). In a rat model of postoperative brain inflammation, taVANS prevented inflammation and neurodegeneration ( Cai et al., 2019 ). Similarly, taVANS was neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory in a rat model of PD ( Jiang et al., 2018 ).","Overview Name: Transcutaneous auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation Synonyms: taVANS, tVANS Therapy Type: Other Target Type: Other Neurotransmitters (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Not Regulated), Mild Cognitive Impairment (Not Regulated), Parkinson's Disease (Not Regulated)",unknown,,False,,24 Feb 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/transcutaneous-auricular-vagal-afferent-nerve-stimulation

It was approved more than 40 years ago to treat major depressive disorder. It is widely used off-label for insomnia and anxiety disorders, and to treat agitation and sleep disturbances in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Taken as a tablet, trazodone is available as a generic. Recent interest in trazodone is focused on its potential to slow cognitive loss by improving sleep in people with early stage memory loss or dementia. Compared to other sleep medications, trazodone has a unique effect of prolonging and deepening slow-wave sleep. Disruption of slow-wave sleep by amyloid and tau deposition appears to contribute to cognitive problems (e.g., Mander et al., 2015 ; Lucey et al., 2019 ). In an observational study of people with AD, MCI, or normal cognition but attending a sleep clinic, those using trazadone showed significantly slower decline in MMSE scores over four years than a matched group who did not take the drug ( La et al., 2019 ; commentary by Ashford, 2019 ; also Burke et al., 2018 ). Slowing of cognitive decline was associated with subjective reports of sleep improvement. There is also emerging evidence from preclinical studies for a possible disease-modifying effect due to trazodone’s ability to enhance proteostasis and protect against neurodegeneration in models of prion disease and frontotemporal dementia ( Halliday et al., 2017 ; also see review by Sidhom et al., 2022 ). In rTg4510 tau mice, it reduced neuroinflammation and tau pathology, and improved sleep and olfactory memory ( de Oliveira et al., 2022 ). For treatment of depression, doses range from 150-300 mg per day, and can go up to 600 mg. Common side effects include dry mouth, feeling faint, hypotension, vomiting, and headache. Trazodone is moderately sedating. This drug can increase the risk of falling, but is nonetheless used for older people with depression, and for severe agitation or insomnia in AD patients (e.g. see Ringman and Schneider 2019 ).

Troculeucel aims to replenish declining natural killer activity in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Natural killer (NK) cells function in the innate immune system as a first line of defense against infections and cancer. They recognize damaged cells and mediate their destruction by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Research on their role in neurodegenerative disease has yielded conflicting results (see Kostic et al., 2025 , for review). Some studies suggest NK cells reduce inflammation by eliminating activated T cells, secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines, or degrading protein aggregates. In a mouse Parkinson’s model, NK cells appeared protective, and their depletion exacerbated α-synuclein pathology ( Earls et al., 2020 ). In contrast, in the 3XTG Alzheimer’s mouse model, NK cells promoted inflammation, and their depletion improved cognitive function ( Zhang et al., 2020 ). NKGen uses a proprietary method for expanding donor cells into a population with increased killing potential. The cells are cryopreserved and thawed as needed. Up to 30 doses can be produced from one expansion. In preclinical work, the NK cells killed activated, but not resting, T cells.

GCS catalyzes an early step in the synthesis of many glycolipids.,"Background Venglustat is a brain-penetrant allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase. GCS catalyzes an early step in the synthesis of many glycolipids. Venglustat is being developed for lysosomal storage diseases, including Gaucher’s, Fabry, and for Parkinson’s caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene. In all these diseases, failure to degrade the glycolipid glucosylceramide leads to its accumulation, resulting in lysosomal dysfunction and organ damage. Venglustat and other GCS inhibitors reduce accumulation of glucosylceramide by preventing its synthesis. Mutations in GBA1, which encodes the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme, are the leading genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease and for dementia with Lewy bodies, two synucleinopathies. Insufficient GBA1 function causes a buildup of both α-synuclein and glucosylceramide ( Jun 2011 news ; Jul 2011 news ). Some work suggests glucosylceramide promotes α-synuclein oligomerization ( Mazzulli et al., 2011 ; Zunke et al., 2017 ). In a cell model of GCase deficiency, the GCS inhibitor miglustat reduced glucosylceramide, slowed the conversion of physiological α-synuclein tetramers into toxic conformations, and protected against α-synuclein fibril-induced toxicity ( Kim et al., 2018 ). No preclinical work is published on venglustat. Sanofi has presented and published results with the related compound GZ667161 ( Sardi et al., 2017 ; Dec 2016 conference news ). In a Gaucher disease model, mice carrying a homozygous GBA D409V mutation were fed the inhibitor from 1 month to 10 months of age, or from 6 to 13 months. GZ667161 treatment reduced brain glucosylceramide levels, as well as accumulation of hippocampal α-synuclein and tau deposits. Treatment reportedly improved memory deficits. In a model of α-synuclein toxicity, treatment of mice overexpressing the A53T mutant from age 1.5 to 8 months reduced glucosylceramide levels, hippocampal membrane-associated α-synuclein and tau deposits, and improved cognition. Two other GCS inhibitors—miglustat and eliglustat—are FDA-approved for treating Gaucher disease. Both drugs are said to poorly penetrate the brain.

The hypothesized mechanism of action of verdiperstat includes reduction of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and countering cell death due to pathological microglia activation. Taken in tablet form, verdiperstat has been shown to enter the brain ( Johnström et al., 2015 ). Verdiperstat was tested in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare and rapidly progressing α-synucleinopathy. In the model, induction of oxidative stress with 3-nitroproprionic acid (3-NP) in animals overexpressing α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes leads to microglia activation, synuclein inclusions, neuron loss, and movement deficits. Treating mice with verdiperstat before and during 3-NP exposure reduced microglial activation, α-synuclein aggregation, and neurodegeneration, and improved motor function ( Stefanova et al., 2012 ).

In humanized TREM2 mice, and in nonhuman primates, the compounds entered the brain. There, they suppressed the levels of soluble TREM2, an extracellular domain receptor fragment. This suggests the compounds may slow processing and internalization of TREM2 ( Apr 2023 conference news ).

This receptor is expressed on microglia and macrophages, and mediates their proliferation and function. VGL101 is claimed to activate TREM2 signaling with sub-nanomolar potency and selectivity. While other TREM2 agonist antibodies are in trials for Alzheimer’s disease, Vigil is developing VGL101 for the treatment of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). A rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease, ALSP is caused by mutations in the gene for the glial protein Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R), which shares a common downstream signaling pathway with TREM2. The rationale for VGL101 is that TREM2 activation should compensate for loss of CSFR1 function and rescue glia function. Vigil licensed this antibody from Amgen, which had published preclinical work on TREM2 antibodies that activated signaling and abrogated defects in microglia carrying the rare R47H TREM2 gene variant, a risk factor for AD ( Cheng et al., 2018 ). Amgen’s monoclonal antibody hT2AB activated microglia in 5XFAD mice with R47H TREM2, but had limited efficacy in mice with the more common TREM2 variant ( Ellwanger et al., 2021 ).

VHB937 binds membrane-anchored TREM2 and the soluble TREM2 cleavage product (sTREM2) with equal affinity. It slows the clearance of, and increases levels of, sTREM2, which has been suggested to have neuroprotective actions ( April 2025 conference news ).

It aims to restore the treatment benefit of oral levodopa for people with advanced Parkinson's disease whose treatment response has started fluctuating. VY-AADC attempts to supply transgenic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme that converts levodopa to dopamine, directly into the putamen area of the brain. As dopaminergic neurons in the brain's substantia nigra degenerate in PD, dopamine levels decrease in their projection area, the striatum encompassing the putamen, where medium spiny neurons survive and maintain expression of dopamine receptors long into PD progression ( Braak et al., 2004 ). The treatment rationale is that local expression of transgenic AADC will boost dopamine levels in the putamen, reducing motor ""off"" time and prolonging ""on"" time for the patient. VY-AADC uses the adeno-associated virus 2 capsid as a vector encoding AADC; expression is driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter.

It is the first dopamine therapy to be delivered by 24-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion.,"Background Vyalev is a new levodopa/carbidopa formulation for dopamine replacement therapy. It is the first dopamine therapy to be delivered by 24-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion. It contains foslevodopa and foscarbidopa, which are modified with phosphate groups to render them more water-soluble. A portable infusion pump delivers this combination under the skin of the abdomen. The goal is to smooth out the peaks and valleys of oral dosing, thus minimizing periods when symptoms return. Dopamine replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Levodopa eases tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons. A prodrug, levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier, where dopamine decarboxylase converts it to dopamine. Levodopa is formulated with carbidopa, a decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the conversion to dopamine in peripheral tissues. This helps prevent the nausea and vomiting produced by levodopa alone, and enables delivery of higher doses to the brain. The combination comes in immediate and slow-release tablet form, and as a gel that is delivered directly into the intestine. Besides nausea, other common side effects are low blood pressure, confusion, and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias. Levodopa can also cause sudden onset of sleep, hallucinations, and increased risk-taking behavior. Over time, many patients on levodopa suffer intermittent return of symptoms. These periods are known as motor fluctuations or OFF periods, when the medication stops working between doses. As patients require increasing doses, involuntary movements known as dyskinesias also increase, associated with peak drug concentrations. The development of continually infusible dopamine replacement was intended to minimize OFF time and troublesome dyskinesias. Levodopa does not improve non-motor symptoms of PD, or slow disease progression.","Overview Name: Vyalev Synonyms: Produodopa, Foslevodopa/Foscarbidopa, ABBV-951, LDp/CDp Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Other Neurotransmitters (timeline) Condition(s): Parkinson's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Parkinson's Disease (Approved) Company: AbbVie Approved for: Motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson’s disease",approved,,False,,13 Nov 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/vyalev

Wave has reported the production of stereoisomerically pure ASOs that preferentially knock down repeat-containing C9ORF72 mRNAs and preserve normal protein expression ( Liu et al., 2021 ). They previously demonstrated that stereopure ASOs more potently initiate mRNA degradation than standard oligomers with random stereochemistry ( Iwamoto et al, 2017 ). WVE-004 was tested in motor neurons derived from patient cells and in a transgenic mouse carrying the human C9ORF72 gene with a repeat expansion; results were presented at conferences in 2021 ( abstract , ALS News Today coverage ).

A non-receptor binding variant of TNFα, XPro1595 forms heterotrimers with native soluble TNFα and prevents its interaction with the type 1 TNFα receptor ( Steed et al., 2003 ). Unlike etanercept and other widely used nonselective TNF inhibitor drugs, this second-generation TNF inhibitor does not block signaling by membrane-bound TNFα through the type 2 receptor. Thus, XPro1595 appears to selectively inhibit neuroinflammation mediated by type 1 receptors, but does not suppress innate immunity or myelination mediated by type 2 receptors ( Zalevsky et al., 2007 ; Brambilla et al., 2011 ). In adult mice, long-term treatment with etanercept, but not XPro1595, suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis, learning, and memory ( Yli-Karjanmaa et al., 2019 ). XPro1595 is administered by subcutaneous injection and enters the brain. TNFα is a central player in inflammatory responses. Its protein levels are low in healthy brain but chronically elevated in many neuroinflammatory diseases, including AD. In animal models of AD, TNFα promotes microglial activation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, accumulation of plaques and tangles, and cognitive decline ( Chang et al., 2017 ). Preclinical XPro1595 evaluation has been reported in three mouse models of AD. In 5XFAD mice, twice-weekly subcutaneous dosing for two months reduced brain amyloid deposition and immune cell infiltration, and improved synaptic function ( Mar 2015 conference news ; MacPherson et al., 2017 ). One-month-old TgCRND8 mice received a one-month continuous subcutaneous infusion of XPro1595 and, by six months, had less amyloid deposition than untreated littermates, as well as normalized hippocampal neuron synaptic function ( Cavanagh et al., 2016 ). Intracranial administration reduced pre-plaque amyloid pathology in 3xTg mice ( McAlpine et al., 2009 ); up to six weeks of intracranial infusions in old rats reduced microglia activation and improved synaptic function and cognition ( Sama et al., 2012 ). Blocking soluble TNFα with XPro1595 was also reported to ameliorate the AD risk that results from the effects of a high-fat, high-glucose diet on insulin metabolism, immune, and neural function ( De Sousa Rodrigues et al., 2019 ; MacPherson et al., 2023 ). XPro1595’s effects were sex-dependent and limited to male mice ( De Sousa Rodriques et al., 2024 ). XPro1595 reportedly improved outcomes in rodent models of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, but no clinical trials are ongoing ( Barnum et al., 2014 ; McCoy et al., 2006 ; Hsiao et al., 2014 ). In a company-sponsored study of five rhesus monkeys with toxin-induced progressive parkinsonism, XPro1595 reduced some markers of inflammation, but did not prevent the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons ( Joers et al., 2020 ). ). It also failed to protect against PD-like pathology and neurotoxicity elicited by α-syn overexpression by itself, or combined with injection of α-syn fibrils in rats ( Christiansen et al., 2025 ; Fredlund et al., 2025 ).

Oleic acid and SCD activity were found to promote α-synuclein neurotoxicity, and inhibitors of the enzyme to prevent it ( Fanning et al., 2019 ; Imberdis et al., 2019 ; Vincent et al., 2018 ). In a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, an SCD inhibitor calmed resting tremor and slowed progressive motor decline.

The rationale behind this therapeutic approach is that ligands for the sigma2 receptor complex are negative allosteric regulators that reduce the affinity of oligomeric Aβ for neuronal receptors, and thus interfere with Aβ-induced synaptic toxicity. CT1812 grew out of screening programs at Cognition Therapeutics. Company scientists have reported that compounds in this series not only block binding of a range of different Aβ species to neuronal receptors but also displace it when applied after Aβ has bound ( Dec 2014 conference news ). Subsequently, company scientists reported the compounds also inhibit the ability of α-synuclein oligomers to induce lysosomal trafficking defects in rat neurons and glia ( Limegrover et al., 2021 ). CT1812 was chemically optimized from a series of small molecules selected for their ability to reverse the synaptotoxicity of soluble Aβ oligomers on cultured neurons ( Rishton et al., 2021 ). Similar compounds in the series have been reported to enter the brain, occupy up to 80 percent of sigma2 receptors, and restore behavioral deficits in APP transgenic mice ( Izzo et al., 2014 ; Izzo et al., 2014 ). In preclinical work, CT1812 facilitated brain clearance of Aβ oligomers and improved cognitive behaviors in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. The compound also displaced Aβ oligomers from human postmortem AD brain tissue ( Izzo et al., 2021 ). The identification of the gene encoding the sigma2 protein has allowed more detailed mechanistic studies on the receptor and the actions of CT1812 ( Alon et al., 2017) . It was reported that a complex of the sigma 2 protein, progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and the low-density lipoprotein receptor controls the internalization of Aβ monomers and oligomers in synapses ( Riad et al., 2020 ). Further studies found evidence for increased synaptic levels of sigma2, also known as TMEM97, in Alzheimer’s disease ( Hesse et al., 2019 ). FRET imaging suggests a close synaptic interaction between Aβ oligomers and TMEM97 in Alzheimer’s brain tissue. In mouse and human models, CT1812 inhibited this interaction, and also caused changes in the expression of genes related to synaptic function ( Colom-Cadena et al., 2024 ).","Overview Name: Zervimesine Synonyms: CT1812 , Elayta Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Amyloid-Related (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Phase 2), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (Phase 2) Company: Cognition Therapeutics Inc.",ongoing,12.0,False,3.0,02 Oct 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/zervimesine

It was approved by the FDA in July 2024 for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia. It comes in delayed-release tablets of 5, 10, or 15 mg. Originally synthesized as GLN-1062/Memogain, this benzoyl ester is more lipophilic than galantamine, in order to facilitate its entry into the brain, where it is enzymatically cleaved to release the active drug. The compound was developed at Galantos Pharma in hopes of increasing the brain bioavailability and reducing peripheral side effects of galantamine. Additional goals were to increase the effective dose in the brain and deliver a therapeutic effect rapidly, without the gradual titration up to effective dose that is commonly necessary with oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In 2013, GLN-1062 was sold to the Canadian company Neurodyn for clinical development. In March 2020, Neurodyn changed its name to Alpha Cognition, and GLN-1062 became ALPHA-1062. Preclinically, GLN-1062 was reported to improve cognition more strongly than did comparable doses of galantamine in mice, and to reduce vomiting in ferrets. Another study claimed five times higher potency than galantamine in rescuing scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice, as well as improved memory performance and reduced plaque load in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Pharmacologically, GLN-1062/Memogain was reported to reach 10 times higher concentration in the brain than blood (see Maelicke et al, 2010 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2015) .","Overview Name: ZunveylTM Synonyms: Benzgalantamine , ALPHA-1062, GLN-1062, Memogain Therapy Type: Small Molecule (timeline) Target Type: Cholinergic System (timeline) Condition(s): Alzheimer's Disease U.S. FDA Status: Alzheimer's Disease (Approved) Company: Alpha Cognition, Galantos Pharma",approved,,False,,28 Jan 2025,https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/zunveyltm
