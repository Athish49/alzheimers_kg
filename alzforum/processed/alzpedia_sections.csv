abca7,overview,Overview,1,"ABCA7 is a member of the highly conserved superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These multipass transmembrane proteins use energy from ATP hydrolysis to transfer molecules across membrane barriers. ABCA7 is abundantly expressed in white blood cells, in macrophages, and in microglia, where it is thought to play a role in phagocytosis. The ABCA7 gene started drawing attention in Alzheimer’s disease research when a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified it as a risk factor for late-onset AD. Subsequent meta-analysis confirmed the association, and the gene ranks among the top 10 risk genes on AlzGene . The association is strongest for African-Americans, in whom one ABCA7 variant was found to nearly double the risk of AD, with an effect size approaching that of ApoE . Despite the evidence linking ABCA7 to AD, the underlying mechanism of ABCA7’s role in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. ABCA7 could impact AD pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including regulation of APP processing and clearance of Aβ through phagocytosis. Overall, the identification of ABCA7 as an AD risk factor further strengthens the importance of lipid homeostasis in the development of the disease."

adam10,overview,Overview,1,"ADAM10 stands for A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10. This membrane protein is a sheddase and thought to be the physiological α-secretase for the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) . In contrast to cleavage by β-secretase, ADAM10-mediated processing of APP is not amyloidogenic because cleavage takes place within the Aβ region, precluding Aβ generation. The proteolytic processing of APP by ADAM10 produces a secreted ectodomain fragment (sAPPα) that has neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties. For these reasons, increasing ADAM10 activity is viewed as potentially therapeutic for Alzheimer’s disease; however, pharmacological approaches have not yet succeeded. Besides APP, physiological substrates of ADAM10 include Notch and various immune and growth factor proteins, and the protease itself can be processed into signaling molecules. ADAM10 influences neural development, neuroprotection, and synaptic physiology. Two rare mutations in ADAM10 have been associated with familial late-onset AD."

amyloid-v-av,overview,Overview,1,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are produced from the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) . Sequential proteolytic cleavage events by β- and γ-secretase generate Aβ peptides of varying lengths, including Aβ40 and Aβ42. Its two extra hydrophobic residues give Aβ42 a higher propensity to aggregate into soluble oligomers and insoluble deposits than Aβ40 or the range of shorter peptides that have been observed in recent years by mass spectrometry analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Multiple aggregated forms exist, from dimers to β-pleated sheet fibrils in compact neuritic plaques, but a primary toxic species, or its mechanism of neuronal toxicity, has not been definitively identified. Mutations linked to familial Alzheimer’s disease generally exert pathogenic effects by increasing overall Aβ levels and/or the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio. Aβ clearance—by way of enzymes, transport along the brain’s vasculature, or microglial phagocytosis—is thought to decrease with aging or as a result of interaction with other genetic risk factors for AD. Excess amounts of Aβ can induce a variety of pathologic processes. Aβ can impair neuronal and glial function, synaptic physiology, neurotransmission, and cognition. Evidence points to transcellular spread and templated seeding, and the resulting deposition of aggregated Aβ into extraneuronal amyloid plaques is a pathological hallmark of AD. Aβ reduction in the CSF starts more than a decade before symptoms; this is a biomarker of AD and clinical-grade CSF assays are being developed. The FDA has approved two positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for the detection of brain amyloid burden during life, but the lack of insurance reimbursement limits their use. Animal models of Aβ amyloidosis respond to therapy with small-molecule and immunotherapy drugs, but these findings have been only partially borne out in human trials. As of yet, no anti-amyloid approach has achieved clinical benefit to support FDA approval."

apoe,overview,Overview,1,"Apolipoprotein E is a secreted apolipoprotein involved in lipid metabolism. It complexes with lipids to form lipoprotein particles that transport cholesterol and triglycerides via the bloodstream and facilitate the transfer of cholesterol and phospholipids between cells in the brain. In the periphery, ApoE is expressed by hepatocytes and macrophages. In the brain, it is produced and secreted primarily by astrocytes and activated microglia. ApoE has three isoforms— ApoE2 , E3, and E4 —with unique cysteine/arginine combinations at positions 130 and 176. Every person has an APOE genotype determined by homozygous or heterozygous pairs of the alleles encoding these isoforms—for example, APOE3/E3 or APOE3/E4. The APOE4 allele is thought to be the ancestral form of the APOE gene which gave rise to APOE2 and APOE3. While APOE4 increases the risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, APOE2 reduces it. The largest datasets from studies of Caucasian populations show APOE4 increasing AD risk in a dose-dependent manner with one allele raising risk about threefold, and two alleles elevating it 10- to 15-fold relative to APOE3. In contrast, one APOE2 allele cuts AD risk down to about half of that of carriers of two APOE3 alleles, and two alleles reduce it to 13 percent. Overall, the population risk that can be attributed to APOE4 is approximately 20 percent, although its effects vary between populations of different ancestries. APOE4 also modifies the age of AD onset, with carriers’ symptoms emerging about five years earlier than those of non-carriers. Whether and under what circumstances APOE4 affects disease progression remains uncertain, although most studies suggest it accelerates it. ApoE4 initiates a cascade of early alterations which can lead to later pathological changes associated with AD, including both gain- and loss-of-function effects relative to ApoE3. It appears to contribute to both hallmark AD pathologies, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, it has been blamed for altering lipid transport and metabolism in brain cells and fueling neuroinflammation, abnormal cellular stress responses, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. ApoE4 has also been reported to reduce neurogenesis, disrupt endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, impair mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, as well as modify transcription. At a tissue level, it appears to alter brain glucose metabolism and cause neural network dysfunction. Multiple approaches to therapeutically counter the harmful effects of ApoE4 are being examined, ranging from directly targeting the protein to mitigating its downstream effects. In addition to the three common APOE alleles— APOE2 , E3, and E4 —genetic variants in other positions, many of them rare, have also been studied (see APOE genetic variant dataset ). Some have been tied to AD or to other neurological disorders, and/or to peripheral conditions including alterations of lipid metabolism, cardiovascular health, and kidney function."

app,overview,Overview,1,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is central to the study of Alzheimer’s disease. Abundant in neurons, APP is a type I transmembrane protein whose proteolysis gives rise to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Rare mutations in APP cause familial Alzheimer’s disease. The majority of pathogenic APP mutations cluster near the cleavage sites of the proteases β-secretase and γ-secretase, and generally increase total Aβ levels and/or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. APP promoter mutations and APP gene duplication have the same effect. Other mutations in APP are associated with rare cases of familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). A protective APP mutation reduces lifetime Aβ generation by 20 percent. In addition, several known genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, including APOE , ABCA7 , BIN1 , CD33 , clusterin , PICALM , and SORLA , are thought to modulate APP biology, with effects on APP processing, trafficking, and clearance. APP interacts with cell-surface proteins, though whether it is primarily a ligand or receptor is unclear. Its extracellular cleavage product sAPPα is neurotrophic; its cleaved intracellular domain AICD has been reported to regulate gene expression, but no target genes have been broadly confirmed. Aside from its role in Aβ generation, various functions have been ascribed to the APP protein. During brain development, these include neuronal and synaptic adhesion, formation of the neuromuscular junction, and cell signaling. In the adult brain, response to neuronal damage has been suggested as an important APP function. APP knockout mice are viable and show subtle phenotypes; when the APP gene family member APLP2 is deleted as well, double knockout mice die at birth. Despite extensive research, the primary physiological function of APP remains an enigma."

bace1,overview,Overview,1,"BACE1 encodes a transmembrane aspartyl protease responsible for β-secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) . APP cleavage by BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in the generation of Aβ peptides, creating the C99 fragment that becomes a substrate for subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. BACE1 is active in the acidic environment of early endosomes and trans-Golgi compartments, where Aβ is generated. Its role in Aβ generation has made BACE1 a target for therapy development, and rational drug design efforts accelerated when the crystal structure of BACE was solved. A handful of BACE inhibitors have come to clinical trial, though some failed in Phase 1 due to safety concerns. BACE inhibitors are being watched for potential off-target effects of BACE1 inhibition, as the protease cleaves several dozen substrates. The best-studied is the cell surface protein neuregulin 1, whose soluble cleavage product signals through the receptor Erb4 on glial cells to regulate myelination. In addition, BACE1 is known to play a role in neurite outgrowth and muscle spindle formation. BACE knockout mice have mild schizophrenia-like and cognitive phenotypes. The physiological function of APP processing by BACE1 remains unclear. The homolog BACE2 differs from BACE1 in its expression pattern and substrate specificity, and appears not to contribute significantly to Aβ generation."

bridging-integrator-1-bin1-0,overview,Overview,1,"Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a widely expressed adaptor protein that is part of the Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167 (BAR) family. BIN1 functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endocytic recycling, as does the AD risk gene PICALM . Whereas brain-specific isoforms may be involved in the retrieval of synaptic vesicles, ubiquitous isoforms of BIN1 participate in apoptosis, inflammation and calcium homeostasis. The bulk of the scientific literature on BIN1 concerns its initially identified roles in tumor suppression and muscle development, but in 2010, a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) discovered that BIN1 was a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. This association was confirmed in subsequent GWAS in different populations and in meta-analyses, and BIN1 remains near the top of AlzGene . The pathogenic mechanism of BIN1 is unknown. A clustering of high-risk polymorphisms upstream of the gene points toward a potential effect on transcription, and AD patients carrying such BIN1 variants have been found to have elevated BIN1 expression in the brain. DNA methylation of the BIN1 promoter has been suggested as a possible epigenetic mechanism influencing AD risk. BIN1 has also been proposed to modulate tau pathology, but the AD-associated variants known to date do not affect CSF tau levels. As an endocytic accessory protein, BIN1 could potentially affect BACE trafficking and APP metabolism, as well. The BIN1 risk locus has been reported to track with certain brain imaging features of AD."

c9orf72,overview,Overview,1,"The most common mutation for familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9ORF72). Identified in 2011, this mutation takes the form of a repeat expansion of the six nucleotides GGGGCC. Healthy people have up to 30 repeats; mutation carriers can have hundreds, but repeat sizing methods are only semi-quantitative and repeat length has not been linked to clinical features. The expansion also explains a portion of sporadic cases. It shows signs of genetic anticipation, leading to earlier onset in successive generations. C9ORF72 expansions vary tremendously in their clinical expression between and among affected families, causing amnestic and psychiatric symptoms in addition to the established features of FTD and ALS. Regardless of their clinical phenotype, C9ORF72 cases all have widespread TDP-43 neuropathology in brain areas that show atrophy and correspond to symptoms. Separately, C9ORF72 cases also feature TDP-43-negative inclusions made of aggregation-prone dipeptide repeats. These dipeptides are translated from the hexanucleotide repeats—which reside in non-coding introns—in an unusual, bidirectional manner previously described for the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 8. Dipeptide inclusions appear in different cells than TDP-43 inclusions, and they do not track with neurodegeneration. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying C9ORF72-associated ALS/FTD are under intense study. Hypotheses include a lack of functional gene product, toxicity of the repeat dipeptides, and sequestration of critical RNA-binding proteins in RNA foci. C9ORF72 encodes an uncharacterized protein whose normal function is not understood. Several lines of induced pluripotent stem cells from C9ORF72 patients have been established, as well as a zebrafish model. Further animal models of C9ORF72 are being developed."

cd33-0,overview,Overview,1,"CD33 is a transmembrane receptor of the innate immune system that is expressed on the surface of peripheral monocytes and microglial cells in the brain. CD33 was first implicated in Alzheimer’s disease genetics in 2008, and in 2011 reached genome-wide significance in large GWAS in the U.S. and Europe. Since then, CD33 has been further validated in independent sample series in Canada, China, and elsewhere. CD33 has primarily been studied in the peripheral immune system, where it inhibits proliferation of myeloid cells. More recent network analyses of gene expression patterns in the human brain placed CD33 inside an immune regulatory module together with other proteins relevant to AD, such as TREM2 , TYROBP, and MSA4A. CD33 encodes a member of a superfamily called sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs). In microglia, CD33 binds extracellular sialylated glycans on other cells or pathogens. Its cytoplasmic domain signals via phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) to dampen microglial phagocytosis; by comparison, TREM2 responds to ligand binding by activating PI3K to increase phagocytosis. In mouse models, CD33 has been shown to slow phagocytosis and Aβ clearance. CD33 expression is elevated in AD brain and has been linked to both amyloid pathology and disease progression. The initial GWAS reported the C allele of the promoter polymorphism rs3865444 of CD33 as increasing AD risk. This SNP was subsequently associated with increased CD33 expression and microglial activation, and with diminished Aβ42 internalization and increased brain amyloid load. Subsequent research identified rs12459419, a protective variant in exon 2 of CD33. This SNP was reported to alter splicing of the CD33 mRNA such that the resulting protein lacks CD33’s sialic acid binding domain and therefore preserves the cell’s ability to take up and clear Aβ. The search for functional CD33 variants and their underlying mechanisms of action is an active area of research."

clusterin,overview,Overview,1,"Clusterin is a highly conserved glycoprotein that functions primarily as an extracellular chaperone. Multiple large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered clusterin variants that strongly associate with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, earning clusterin a spot on AlzGene ’s top 10 risk genes. Clusterin levels are elevated in the AD brain, but how the protein affects AD pathogenesis is unknown. One idea holds that pathogenic clusterin variants weaken the brain’s ability to respond to stressors, another that they work through reduced expression of clusterin. Prevailing hypotheses revolve around clusterin’s ability to bind Aβ peptides and thereby influence their aggregation, deposition, and/or clearance, but the underlying mechanism(s) remain to be delineated. Functional studies are starting to associate clusterin variants with neurological phenotypes. Clusterin is detectable in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, but thus far it has not proven useful as a biomarker."

complement-receptor-1-cr1,overview,Overview,1,"The complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions in the innate immune system. CR1 is expressed on blood cells and microglia. As a receptor for the complement components C3b and C4b, CR1 helps regulate activation of the complement cascade and promotes phagocytosis of immune complexes and cellular debris, as well as A β . CR1 attracted attention in Alzheimer’s research when variants at the CR1 locus proved to be associated with risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Meta-analysis has confirmed several disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as a copy-number variation (CNV). CR1 currently ranks among the top 10 risk genes on AlzGene . At least one risk SNP is also linked to intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). While the molecular underpinnings of CR1’s role in AD pathogenesis are not yet clear, accumulating evidence suggests a dysregulation of complement with effects on inflammation and amyloid accumulation. Clinically, a CR1 risk allele has been associated with faster cognitive decline and greater neuropathology burden in longitudinal aging cohorts."

fus,overview,Overview,1,"Originally identified as a pro-oncogene, FUS came to the attention of neurodegenerative disease research in 2009, when mutations in this gene were linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). FUS mutations account for about 4 percent of inherited ALS, including some juvenile-onset cases. FUS mutations in sporadic ALS are rare. FUS protein forms part of disease-related aggregates in most kinds of ALS, regardless of whether a FUS mutation is present. An exception to this is ALS caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase 1, SOD1. In FTD, mutations in FUS are rare; however, the FUS protein has become the characteristic pathological marker for neuronal inclusions in the subset of sporadic FTD cases that lack the more established aggregate markers TDP-43 and tau . FUS is a member of a protein family called FET, which includes FUS, Ewing’s sarcoma or EWS, and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 or TAF15. These are RNA-binding proteins that participate in transcription, processing and nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport of mRNAs. One emerging difference between ALS-FUS and FTD-FUS is that only the latter typically involves co-aggregation of the FET proteins EWS and TAF15 along with FUS itself. More than 40 FUS mutations have been identified in ALS. Many occur in a terminal nuclear localization sequence or in a glycine-rich region that forms part of a prion-like domain involved in protein-protein interactions. Like TDP-43, another ALS gene and RNA-binding protein, FUS is normally a nuclear protein but in disease states it redistributes to the cytoplasm and forms RNA-protein granules. Researchers have used yeast, Drosophila , nematodes, zebrafish, rats and mice to model FUS biology. FUS knockouts in rodents indicate that the gene is required for normal development. Mice expressing FUS mutatations develop a progressive motor neuron degeneration and paralysis somewhat like ALS, whereas those overexpressing wild-type FUS showing a milder phenotype. Currently, researchers are investigating whether mutant FUS toxicity results from a loss of normal nuclear function, a toxic gain of function in the cell body, or both. Scientists are also studying the more than 5,000 known mRNAs that are targets of FUS for clues about the protein’s normal function and role in disease."

gba,overview,Overview,1,"Homozygous mutations in the GBA gene cause Gaucher’s disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder. GBA generated interest in the neurodegeneration field when clinicians observed parkinsonian symptoms in some patients with Gaucher’s—an autosomal recessive disease—and an increased incidence of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in their heterozygous older relatives. Subsequent studies in large samples of PD patients established GBA mutations as a genetic risk factor for PD, as well as for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). Initially found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, this was subsequently confirmed in other populations and in meta-analyses of PD samples worldwide. GBA currently ranks third in PDGene , after tau and α -synuclein . GBA mutations increase a person’s risk of PD, PDD, and DLB about fourfold. Upward of 5 percent of all patients with PD are estimated to have a GBA mutation; that number is higher in familial PD. GBA is one of a growing number of genes that can cause a severe, early onset disease in homozygous carriers of a pathogenic mutation and a later-onset neurodegenerative disease in heterozygous carriers of the same mutation. Another example of this is TREM2 . Clinically, Gaucher’s disease occurs in three subtypes, one that affects the liver and spleen, bone, and blood, and two that also affect the central nervous system (see OMIM links below). Parkinson’s disease linked to heterozygous GBA mutations is indistinguishable from sporadic PD clinically, pharmacologically, and in terms of drug response, although it begins earlier in life and is likelier to affect cognition, as well. GBA encodes glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase that digests glycolipids. When the enzyme’s activity is impaired, these lipids build up in lysosomes, leading to cellular damage and inflammation. As PD, PDD, and DLB are diseases of α-synuclein aggregation, the link between GBA and α-synuclein is under intense study. A bi-directional pathway connecting GBA and α-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both idiopathic and genetic forms of PD, PDD, and DLB. Pathogenic GBA mutations tend to cause loss of function and accumulation of the enzyme’s substrate glucosylceramide; this has been proposed to lead to a buildup and oligomerization of α-synuclein. In turn, high levels of α-synuclein interfere with the lysosomal function of wild-type glucocerebrosidase. In animal models, reduced glucocerebrosidase function increases the accumulation of α-synuclein, whereas ramping up glucocerebrosidase expression ameliorates disease symptoms. Broadly speaking, protein quality-control pathways such as autophagy, the unfolded protein response, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both Gaucher’s and Parkinson’s. Enzyme-replacement therapy with recombinant glucocerebrosidase is available for people with Gaucher’s. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, hence it cannot treat the disease’s neurological symptoms, or PD, PDD, or DLB. The role of GBA in these diseases has renewed interest in the development of CNS-targeted therapies that boost glucocerebrosidase activity in the brain."

leucine-rich-repeat-kinase-2-lrrk2,overview,Overview,1,"Missense mutations in LRRK2 were first identified as a cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in 2004. Subsequent studies showed that these mutations account for up to 10 percent of familial cases, with even higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish and North African Arab populations. In addition, polymorphic LRRK2 variants occur in about 2 percent of sporadic cases, making LRRK2 one of the most common PD genes. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified many LRRK2 variants in PD patients; of those, Gly2019Ser is the most common of six variants known thus far to be pathogenic. LRRK2 currently ranks fourth on PDGene . LRRK2 missense mutations have an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. Unlike the APP or PS1 pathogenic Alzheimer’s mutations, whose penetrance is nearly complete, LRRK2 mutation penetrance is incomplete and highly variable. PD develops in 25 to 80 percent of LRRK2 mutation carriers, depending on the study sample. LRRK2-associated Parkinson’s first becomes symptomatic across a wide age range, but its clinical progression and pathology closely resemble that of idiopathic PD. Additionally, lrrk2 protein levels are elevated in sporadic PD. LRRK2 is expressed throughout the brain in both neurons and microglia. Microglial expression rises in response to infection and inflammation. LRRK2 is also expressed in circulating immune cells, pointing to a role in innate immunity. Indeed, LRRK2 has also been linked to Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel diseases. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 encodes a large, complex protein containing a kinase, a GTPase, and multiple protein-protein interaction domains. The interplay of its enzymatic kinase and signaling GTPase domains remains unknown. The G2019S LRRK2 mutation increases lrrk2’s kinase activity, but other pathogenic variants have different effects, including dampening kinase or GTPase activity. Animal and cell culture studies have linked lrrk2’s kinase activity to toxicity, and kinase inhibitors are being pursued as a therapeutic strategy for PD. Even so, the role of the kinase remains controversial; other groups have found that toxicity depends instead on the cellular concentration of lrrk2 protein. Lrrk2 has been implicated in numerous cellular processes, particularly protein trafficking, recycling of synaptic and Golgi vesicles, mitophagy, and autophagy, but the overall physiological function and regulation of LRRK2 is not clear. Lrrk2 promotes the accumulation of a-synuclein deposits by an unknown mechanism, and evidence shows that autophagy slows in cells expressing pathogenic LRRK2 variants. Exactly how mutations predispose to Parkinson’s disease remains poorly understood a decade after LRRK2’s discovery as a PD gene, in part because rodent models of LRRK2 recapitulate aspects of PD, but not the full disease. LRRK2 has become a central focus of Parkinson’s research. At the molecular level, points of interaction with other PD genes are being studied to establish pathways of pathogenesis. At the human research level, a large longitudinal cohort study tracks mutation carriers in several populations worldwide to characterize the preclinical stages of pathology and to find biomarkers that predict disease progression."

PICALM was identified in one of the first large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and remains one of the top 10 risk genes on AlzGene . Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and around the PICALM gene have been associated with AD; however, the pathogenic variant(s) and the underlying mechanisms by which they affect a person’s risk of AD remain unknown. PICALM is involved in many cellular processes, with many opportunities to influence AD pathogenesis. A prominent hypothesis holds that it affects internalization of APP and thus the production of Aβ. Additionally, PICALM could act through effects on the endocytosis and trafficking of other molecules important for neuronal function."

presenilin-1-psen1,overview,Overview,1,"Presenilins were originally identified as the genes harboring mutations that cause autosomal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease. Such mutations occur in both presenilin-1 and its homolog presenilin-2 , but the former are far more numerous. The presenilin proteins are large multi-pass transmembrane proteins that form the catalytic core of the membrane-embedded γ-secretase complex. This complex also contains the proteins nicastrin, aph-1, and pen-2, and subserves a multitude of cell signaling functions by way of regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Gamma-secretase cleaves many different type I integral membrane proteins, most prominently APP and Notch. It does so in a characteristic, processive fashion that releases Aβ peptides of different lengths. The primary pathogenic mechanism of the presenilin mutations involves subtle changes to these processive cleavage steps that shifts Aβ generation toward longer, more aggregation-prone peptides (e.g., more Aβ42, less Aβ38). Intracellularly, presenilins occur in endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the endoplasmic reticulum, where presenilin-1 is thought to facilitate cellular protein trafficking and to regulate calcium homeostasis. Presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, which share 67 percent sequence identity, have distinct but overlapping functions in the brain. Presenilin-1 may play a larger role in development, as knockout mice have severe skeletal and brain abnormalities and die soon after birth, whereas presenilin-2 knockout mice are viable. Mouse models of pathogenic presenilin-1 mutations exist; when crossed with human mutant APP mouse strains, they tend to increase amyloid pathology. In addition, these mice model the established increase in the AD biomarker CSF tau, as well as some synaptic and behavioral phenotypes; however, they do not reflect the full course of Alzheimer’s disease. Gamma-secretase is a leading target of drug discovery research. Thus far, all small-molecule inhibitors have failed in part because they also inhibit Notch cleavage; the current focus is on small-molecule modifiers that shift Aβ production without affecting Notch. Because Notch signaling has a role in tumor suppression, presenilins are also associated with cancer."

presenilin-2-psen2,overview,Overview,1,"Presenilin-2 (PSEN2) is one of two highly homologous presenilin genes expressed in vertebrates. Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) has been more extensively studied in Alzheimer’s research because fewer mutations in PSEN2 are known. Mutations in the presenilin genes are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer’s disease, with more than 150 total mutations identified, of which about a dozen are in PSEN2. Mutations further differ from those in PSEN1 in that their onset age is somewhat later and their penetrance lower; that is, some mutation carriers do not develop Alzheimer’s disease. Much information about these two proteins applies to both. Like presenilin-1, presenilin-2 forms the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex that processes amyloid precursor protein (APP) and other integral membrane proteins. Comprising presenilin, nicastrin, aph-1, and pen-2, this large complex comprises one protein each of presenilin, nicastrin, aph-1, and pen-2; depending on which isoform of the four constituent proteins is used, this large complex occurs in different types. Besides presenilin, aph-1, too, comes in different forms, called aph-1a and aph-1b/c. Mice in which individual isoforms of these varying complex constituents have been deleted have different phenotypes. This suggests different substrate specificity of the respective complexes, giving clues to the differential function of presenilin-2 to presenilin-1. As part of γ-secretase, both presenilins can cleave APP to produce Aβ peptides and other proteolytic fragments, but the presenilins are thought to differ in their physiological roles. Presenilin-2 is generally expressed at lower levels than presenilin-1."

progranulin,overview,Overview,1,"Progranulin burst on the scene of neurodegenerative disease as a major genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 2006, only months before TDP-43 was identified as the main protein constituent of the histopathological lesions in the same patients. Up to that point, the only known FTD gene had been MAPT , located near the progranulin gene, GRN, on chromosome 17q21, and the twin discoveries broke a double logjam in the field. The roughly 70 GRN mutations known to date explain all 17q21-linked autosomal-dominant FTD families not accounted for by tau mutations, and because all FTD patients with a GRN mutation have TDP-43 pathology, TDP-43 explains these family’s tau-negative protein inclusions. GRN mutations explain up to 20 percent of familial and 5 percent of sporadic FTD. Histopathological commonalities notwithstanding, GRN mutations lead to a variety of clinical presentations, causing mostly behavioral FTD and progressive nonfluent aphasia, but also rare presentations of Alzheimer’s disease or parkinsonism. All pathologic GRN mutations reduce progranulin levels or result in loss of function. Indeed, blood progranulin levels indicate the presence of a pathogenic progranulin mutation and are rapidly becoming a diagnostic biomarker. Progranulin is a secreted growth factor known for its role in biological processes such as inflammation, wound healing, and cancer, and for its neurotrophic properties. It is proteolytically processed into peptides called granulins, which are poorly understood. Progranulin’s role in FTD is being investigated in parallel with potential therapeutic approaches aimed at increasing its levels in the CNS. Several factors are known to influence progranulin expression. They include intrinsic factors, for example the gene TMEM106B and various microRNAs, as well as pharmacological agents, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA and certain alkalizing drugs. Agents targeting the endocytic progranulin receptor sortilin-1 appear to increase plasma progranulin levels by slowing its internalization. Homozygous GRN mutations cause the rare lysosomal storage disease ceroid lipofuscinosis, and progranulin localizes to intraneuronal membrane compartments, including lysosomes. Both homozygous and heterozygous GRN knockout mice exist; the former show both behavioral and inflammatory phenotypes, the latter develop only the former."

snca-synuclein-0,overview,Overview,1,"Point mutations in the α-synuclein gene (SNCA), as well as duplication or triplication of wild-type SNCA, cause autosomal-dominant Parkinson’s disease. α-synuclein is abundantly expressed in the nervous system. In neurons, the protein is primarily localized to presynaptic terminals. Under normal conditions, α-synuclein exists as a natively unfolded monomer or is bound to membranes with an a-helical secondary structure. Though the protein’s primary physiological function remains ambiguous, it has been implicated in synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter release, and fatty acid uptake. α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, intracellular aggregates that represent a neuropathologic hallmark of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Multiple system atrophy (MSA). Lewy bodies are also found in many patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Early in the path to forming these fibrillar, insoluble aggregates, the α-synuclein protein accumulates, misfolds, and aggregates into soluble oligomeric species. α-synuclein can be secreted and taken up by other cells; it is thought that misfolded α-synuclein propagates from one cell to anatomically connected cells, triggering aggregation in the recipient cell. In this way, a slow spread from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical areas would give rise to the stereotypical pattern of Lewy body pathology in PD. These smaller aggregates may be the main pathogenic species that cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity may involve remodeling of membranes, impairment of mitochondria, and dysfunction of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. High levels are associated with impaired cognition in humans and in transgenic mouse models, and soluble α-synuclein is elevated in AD brain. The concentration of α-synuclein in the CSF is reduced in PD and DLB, and it is being explored as a potential biomarker for the differential diagnosis of these diseases against AD. Co-occurring α-synuclein and Aβ or tau pathology is a sign of worse prognosis and frequently marks mixed disease such as DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD.) PET tracers for α-synuclein are at the animal research stage. α-synuclein is a drug target, and therapeutic antibodies are beginning to enter early stage clinical trials."

sorla-sorl1,overview,Overview,1,"The sortilin-related receptor SORLA is an endocytic receptor that belongs to the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain receptor family. SORLA binds to the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ). It functions as an intracellular sorting receptor as APP is being trafficked between the secretory pathway, the cell surface, and, subsequently, endosomes. SORLA is localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network and early endosomes, shuttling between these two membrane compartments. SORLA’s interaction with APP in endosomal compartments limits the amyloidogenic proteolysis of APP. Reduced brain levels of SORLA are thought to alter the transport and processing of APP to increase generation of Aβ peptides in early or late endosomes. SORLA is highly expressed in the brain. Expression is reported to be normal in familial Alzheimer's disease caused by mutations in presenilin or APP genes, but decreased in some cases of sporadic late-onset AD. In these cases, loss of SORLA activity has been hypothesized to be a proximal cause of amyloidosis. In addition, several private nonsense and missense mutations in SORLA that decrease SORLA levels in the brain were found in rare cases of familial AD. A genetic association of SORLA with AD is well established. Population-based studies initially linked nearly 30 SNPs in SORLA to increased risk of AD, and subsequent studies, meta-analyses, and GWAS have confirmed some of these associations. The genetic data on SORLA and LOAD is complex, with at least six different polymorphisms pointing toward the existence of several causative variants in distinct regions of the gene. Several SORLA variants associated with AD have been reported to result in reduced SORLA protein levels, though overall regulation of SORLA expression is only partially understood. CSF biomarker studies of SORLA are inconclusive, with some but not all studies showing reduction in LOAD. In addition to being a sorting receptor, SORLA has structural features of lipoprotein receptors, particularly the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. It therefore may affect AD risk through its effects on lipoprotein signaling pathways, especially those involving the LDLR ligand apolipoprotein E . Besides ApoE, ligands that interact with SORLA’s extracellular portion include the growth factors GDNF and BDNF; however, the relevance, if any, of this binding to AD is unknown. As a type-1 transmembrane protein, SORLA can undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis and in the process shed a soluble ectodomain, but the physiological relevance of this fragment is unclear."

tau-mapt,overview,Overview,1,"Tau has been the subject of study since its discovery in 1975. Its physiological function is to bind tubulin and stabilize microtubules; in this way it supports cell differentiation, polarization, and other processes involving the cytoskeleton. The pathogenic mechanism of tau in Alzheimer’s disease is less established. Recent hypotheses favor trans-synaptic propagation of a pathologic aggregate, leading eventually to microtubule breakdown and neurodegeneration. Tau is primarily an intracellular protein, though recent evidence shows that it is also actively secreted. Histopathologically, aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into tangles and similar deposits occurs broadly across AD, frontotemporal dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases. In AD, neurofibrillary pathology follows a stereotypical pattern that correlates well with the degree of dementia and forms the basis for staging the disease at autopsy. Genetically, however, mutations in the human tau gene MAPT only cause FTD, not AD. As AD develops, tau is thought to change subsequent to Aβ, although the connection between the two is unclear. In human cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), tau levels become abnormal years after Aβ levels do, and in experimental models Aβ-induced toxicity requires the presence of tau. In the human brain, six tau isoforms are expressed from a single gene by alternative splicing, resulting in proteins with either three or four microtubule binding repeats; some pathogenic mutations shift the 4R/3R ratio of the healthy brain. In AD, tau undergoes post-translational changes including ubiquitination, oxidation, nitration, acetylation, proteolytic cleavage, and glycation, but it is unclear which are causes and which are consequence of the disease process. In mature neurons most tau protein occurs in axons; missorting of tau toward the somatodendritic compartment is an early sign of neurodegeneration in AD mouse models. Mouse models of pathogenic tau mutations show tau aggregation, toxicity, neuronal loss, and behavioral deficits. CSF tau levels are a leading biomarker for AD. PET tracers are in early clinical development and are expected to accelerate drug development directed at tau, which is in its infancy."

tdp-43,overview,Overview,1,"In 2006, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) was identified as the cardinal protein in the most common subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Together with the 2006 discovery of progranulin, this was a major breakthrough in the study of FTD. TDP-43 is a widely expressed nuclear protein that binds both DNA and RNA. While shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm, it helps regulate many aspects of RNA processing, such as splicing, trafficking, stabilization, and miRNA production. For example, TDP-43 affects RNAs that encode proteins involved in autophagy and other cellular protein homeostasis and clearance pathways. A role in axonal transport has also been proposed. In neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal and glial TDP-43 becomes mislocalized to the cytoplasm, where it aggregates into stress granules and insoluble inclusion bodies. These inclusions occur in all people with FTD or ALS caused by mutations in C9ORF72 , progranulin , valosin-containing protein, or TDP-43 itself, as well as in some familial cases of unknown mutation and some sporadic cases, and in about a quarter of Alzheimer’s disease cases. Regardless of the proximal cause of a given patient’s disease, distribution of TDP-43 pathology tends to correlate with brain areas of atrophy and the stage of dementia, hence TDP-43 dysregulation is considered to reflect a common downstream mechanism of neurodegeneration. A staging scheme to classify TDP pathology at autopsy has been proposed. Whether the inclusions themselves or soluble species are toxic remains unclear. TDP-43 protein is 96 percent identical between human and mice, and more than a dozen knockout and transgenic lines of wild-type and mutant TDP-43 have been created. Most reflect some pathologic features of ALS/FTD but not the corresponding functional deficits; brain-specific conditional models may be required. Zebrafish, fruit fly, worm, and human induced pluripotent stem cell models exist as well, and are used in efforts to define the protein’s role in the pathogenesis of these diseases."

trem2,overview,Overview,1,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a receptor of the innate immune system expressed on microglia, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. TREM2 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Endogenous ligands of this receptor are unknown but when triggered, it signals through the transmembrane adapter protein TYROBP/DAP12 to activate phagocytosis of pathogens and cellular debris. Anti-inflammatory properties of TREM2 have also been described, whereby TREM2 supresses expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and microglia. In 2012, functional variants of TREM2 were associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. The R47H variant in particular was reported to nearly triple the risk of AD, although the exact genetic burden of this and other TREM2 variants requires further research. Autosomal recessive mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease; this rare genetic disorder of bone abnormalities and progressive dementia is fatal by mid-life. Preliminary evidence suggests that TREM2 may affect AD pathogenesis via amyloid-related neuroinflammation and via phagocytosis of amyloid and neuronal debris. Of note, however, patients with Nasu-Hakola disease who lack TREM2 develop no plaque pathology. Network analysis of gene expression data in AD-relevant brain regions, including the hippocampus, has identified TREM2 as a regulatory hub that connects to other genes implicated in Alzheimer’s and related diseases. Although the exact pathological mechanisms remain to be worked out, the association of TREM2 and AD underscores the importance of innate immunity and microglial activity in neurodegeneration."
